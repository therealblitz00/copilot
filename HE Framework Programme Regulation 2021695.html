Provisions should be laid down to ensure that beneficiaries provide open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications. Likewise, it should be ensured that beneficiaries provide open access to research data following the principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary', while ensuring the possibility of exceptions taking into account the legitimate interests of the beneficiaries. More emphasis should in particular be given to the responsible management of research data, which should comply with the principles of 'findability', 'accessibility', 'interoperability' and 'reusability' (the 'FAIR principles'), in particular through the mainstreaming of data management plans. Where appropriate, beneficiaries should make use of the possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and the European Data Infrastructure and adhere to further open science principles and practices. Reciprocity in open science should be encouraged in all association and cooperation agreements with third countries.</p>

Those recommendations include the proposal of measures to promote brain circulation and facilitate openness of R&amp;I networks to invest more ambitiously in order to reach critical mass and maximise impact; to support breakthrough innovation; to prioritise Union R&amp;I investments in areas of high added value, in particular through mission-orientation, full, well-informed and timely citizen involvement and wide communication; to rationalise the Union funding landscape in order to fully use the R&amp;I potential, including research infrastructures across the Union, such as by streamlining the range of European Partnership initiatives and co-funding schemes; to develop more and concrete synergies between different Union funding instruments, in particular by overcoming non-complementary intervention logics and complexity of the various funding and other regulations also with the aim of helping to mobilise under-exploited R&amp;I potential across the Union; to strengthen international cooperation and reinforce openness to third countries' participation; and to continue simplification based on implementation experiences of Horizon 2020.</p>

Support schemes provided by the EIT should benefit EIC beneficiaries, while start-ups emerging from the EIT's KICs should have simplified and thereby faster access to EIC actions. While the EIT's focus on innovation ecosystems should make it naturally fit within the pillar 'Innovative Europe', it should also support the other pillars, as appropriate.
