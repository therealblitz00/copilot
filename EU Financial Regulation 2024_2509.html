With regard to budget implementation, the application of that principle implies that citizens should know where, and for what purpose, funds are spent by the Union. Such information fosters democratic debate, contributes to the participation of citizens in the Union’s decision-making process, reinforces institutional control and scrutiny over Union expenditure, and contributes to boosting its credibility. Communication should be more targeted and should aim to increase the visibility of the Union contribution for citizens. Such objectives should be achieved by the publication, preferably using modern communication tools, of relevant information concerning all recipients of funds financed from the budget which takes into account those recipients’ legitimate interests of confidentiality and security and, as far as natural persons are concerned, their right to privacy and the protection of their personal data. Union institutions should therefore adopt a&nbsp;selective approach in the publication of information, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Decisions to publish should be based on relevant criteria in order to provide meaningful information.</p>

It is therefore necessary to allow the deduction from the revenue of the budget of any interest or other charge due on the amounts of cancelled or reduced fines, other penalties or sanctions, including any negative return related to those amounts. This exception to the prohibition on negative revenue should be limited to that specific situation. In order to comply with the general principle of restoration to the prior state (<span class="oj-italic">restitutio in integrum</span>) applicable to fines, other penalties or sanctions imposed by Union institutions that are later cancelled or reduced by the Court of Justice of the European&nbsp;Union, it is necessary to provide that any negative return on the provisionally collected amount of such fines, other penalties or sanctions imposed by Union institutions not be deducted from the amount to be repaid. To compensate for the loss of enjoyment of monies from the date the concerned third parties provisionally paid the fine to the Commission until the date of repayment, the amount to be repaid should be increased by interest at the rate applied by the European Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations increased by one and a&nbsp;half percentage points as an adequate compensation for such third parties in such situations, which excludes the need to apply any other interest rate on that amount. Furthermore, that rate corresponds to the interest rate applicable in relation to the debtor when the debtor chooses to defer the payment of a&nbsp;fine, other penalty or sanction, and provides a&nbsp;financial guarantee instead of payment. Such interest and charges should only be deducted as negative revenue until 31&nbsp;December 2027, pending a&nbsp;definitive solution for the multiannual financial framework after 2027 relative to the rate of interest and other charges that should be paid as adequate compensation for the reimbursement of cancelled or reduced fines, other penalties or sanctions. This definitive solution should take stock of past experience and expected future developments and should be in line with the application of the budgetary principles laid down in this Regulation. In order to secure sufficient cash flow to compensate the concerned third parties for the loss of enjoyment of monies where a&nbsp;fine, other penalty or sanction has been cancelled or their amount has been reduced, it could be necessary to allow for the amounts received by way of fines, other penalties or sanctions and any accrued interest or other income generated by them to be entered in the budget by the end of the following financial year. In order to ensure full transparency of this mechanism, the Commission should provide all information available in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure to the European Parliament and to the&nbsp;Council.</p>

That transfer also aims to avoid duplication and to mitigate the risks of contradictory recommendations or opinions, in cases where both an economic operator and a&nbsp;member of staff of a&nbsp;Union institution or body are involved.

Whilst respecting any international agreements of the Union, the award of Union funds in relation to strategic assets and interests, such as digital or space infrastructure, communication and information systems and services, can require the application of specific conditions to ensure such protection including for the integrity of communication and information systems, and of related supply chains. The types of conditions and requirements for applying them should be clarified.

It is important to avoid that a&nbsp;person or entity in an exclusion situation is able to apply for or to be selected for implementing Union funds, or to receive such funds under a&nbsp;programme in shared management. Where there is a&nbsp;final judgment or a&nbsp;final administrative decision, the authorising officer responsible should be able to exclude a&nbsp;person or entity, provided that the latter is in an exclusion situation and deemed not reliable due to having engaged in certain types of serious misconduct. Without prejudice to information obligations set out in other basic acts, persons and entities implementing the budget under shared management should convey to the Commission, through any official channel, such as the automated information system established by the Commission currently in use for reporting of fraud and irregularities (the ‘Irregularity Management System’), information pertaining to established facts and findings, in the context of such final judgments or final administrative decisions only with reference to the grounds set out under Article&nbsp;138(1), points (c)(iv) and (d), when they become aware of such information. In the absence of a&nbsp;final judgment or a&nbsp;final administrative decision, the authorising officer responsible should be able to exclude, on the basis of a&nbsp;preliminary classification in law made by the panel, having regard to facts and findings established in the context of audits or investigations carried out by OLAF, the EPPO or the Court of Auditors or any other check, audit or control performed under the responsibility of the authorising officer. Such exclusion should be registered in the early detection and exclusion system database. Persons and entities implementing the budget under shared management should consult the early detection and exclusion system database prior to awarding Union funds or selecting participants and beneficiaries. This consultation should concern the person or entity applying for or selected to implement Union funds. To ensure the effective implementation of the early detection and exclusion system, the competent authorities of the Member States should enforce the exclusions recorded in the database with regard to such persons or entities applying for or selected to implement Union funds for the entire duration of the exclusion. That exclusion should uphold the integrity of the procurement or selection process and safeguard it against the participation of individuals or entities involved in a&nbsp;serious misconduct. Payment applications from Member States under shared management, including expenditure related to a&nbsp;person or entity that has been excluded, should not be reimbursed. Where funds are disbursed to Member States under performance-based frameworks, specific rules should apply, as set out in sector-specific rules.</p>

Without prejudice to these responsibilities of the Commission, the Member States remain responsible to verify the information on decisions of exclusion registered in the early detection and exclusion system database, to enforce such decisions and to ensure that no payment application is submitted in respect of a&nbsp;person or entity that is in such an exclusion situation.

In order to allow the flexibility needed to ensure a&nbsp;rapid response to unforeseen circumstances of extreme urgency resulting from a&nbsp;crisis, the contracting authority should be allowed to apply simplified procurement rules, such as use of negotiated procedure without prior publication of a&nbsp;contract notice applicable to crisis situations and acceptance of evidence on exclusion and selection criteria from the presumed successful tenderer after the award decision but in any case before the signature of the contract. The contracting authority should also have flexibility to exceptionally modify a&nbsp;contract or a&nbsp;framework contract, beyond the applicable thresholds, without a&nbsp;procurement procedure in order to respond to a&nbsp;crisis. Moreover, in a&nbsp;situation of crisis it should be possible, exceptionally, to add new contracting authorities after the launch of a&nbsp;procurement procedure and before the contract signature or following a&nbsp;modification of a&nbsp;contract without restricting competition. A&nbsp;declaration of crisis should be required in line with the relevant internal rules prior to having recourse to such simplified rules, except for procurement in the field of external action where such declaration is not required. In addition, the authorising officers responsible should justify case-by-case the extreme urgency resulting from the declared crisis.</p>

The notion of a&nbsp;‘conflict of interests’ should be solely used for cases where a&nbsp;person or entity with responsibilities for budget programming, implementation, audit or control, or an official or an agent of a&nbsp;Union institution or national authorities at any level, is in such a&nbsp;situation. Attempts to unduly influence an award procedure or obtain confidential information should be treated as grave professional misconduct which can lead to the rejection from the award procedure and/or exclusion from Union funds. In addition, economic operators might be in a&nbsp;situation where they should not be selected to implement a&nbsp;contract because of a&nbsp;professional conflicting interest. For instance, a&nbsp;company should not evaluate a&nbsp;project in which it has participated or an auditor should not be in a&nbsp;position to audit accounts it has previously certified. The assessment of conflicts of interest, and the obligation to set up systems to detect and prevent such conflicts, should respect the principle of proportionality. Appropriate guidance on the assessment of conflicts of interest should provide additional clarification to those assessing such situations at Union and national level, with a&nbsp;view to contributing to legal certainty.</p>

Contracting authorities which make use of any of those award criteria should ensure, by appropriate contractual means, that the staff assigned to contract performance effectively fulfil the specified quality standards. The contracting authorities should give their consent to any replacement of such staff and should verify whether replacing staff affords an equivalent level of quality as the replaced staff. Furthermore, it should be ensured that there is no overlap and double evaluation of the same element under the selection and award criteria.</p>

In particular, those systems should be operated in the form of a&nbsp;restricted procedure, thus allowing for any economic operator that submits a&nbsp;request to participate and meets the exclusion and selection criteria to take part in procurement procedures carried out through the dynamic purchasing system over its period of validity, which should not be limited to four years. Tenders can also be presented in the form of an electronic catalogue particularly for off-the-shelf products or services generally available on the market. Moreover, in order to reduce the administrative burden, the requirement to appoint an opening and evaluation committee should be waived for specific procurements under a&nbsp;dynamic purchasing system.</p>

Regardless of the field of Union intervention, lump sums, unit costs and flat rates are suitable forms of financing, in particular for standardised and recurrent actions, such as mobility or training activities. Moreover, as institutional cooperation between public administrations of Member States and of beneficiary or partner countries (institutional twinning) is implemented by Member State institutions, the use of simplified cost options is justified and should foster their engagement. In the interest of increased efficiency, Member States and other recipients of Union funds should be able to make more frequent use of simplified cost options. In this context, the conditions for using lump sums, unit costs and flat rates should be made more flexible. It is necessary to provide explicitly for the establishment of single lump sums covering the entire eligible costs of the action or the work programme. In addition, in order to foster focus on results, priority should be given to output-based funding. Input-based lump sums, unit costs and flat rates should remain an option where output-based ones are not possible or appropriate.</p>

The frequency and scope of the periodic assessment should depend on the evolution and the nature of the costs, in particular taking into account substantial changes in market prices and other relevant circumstances.

In the interests of transparency and effective decision-making, the Commission should, as early as possible, provide detailed information to the European Parliament and the Council on any intended contribution to a&nbsp;global initiative, so as to enable them to give that information due consideration.</p>
