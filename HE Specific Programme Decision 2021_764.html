            <p class="oj-normal">In the pillar 'Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness' and the pillar 'Innovative Europe', R&amp;I shall be complemented by activities which operate close to end-users and the market, such as demonstration, piloting or proof-of-concept, excluding however commercialisation activities going beyond the R&amp;I phase. Those activities shall also include support to demand-side activities that help accelerate the deployment and diffusion of a broad range of innovations. Emphasis shall be put on non-prescriptive calls for proposals.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Under the pillar 'Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness', building on experience in Horizon 2020, the SSH shall be fully integrated across all clusters, including specific and dedicated activities. Likewise, activities involving marine and maritime R&amp;I shall be implemented in a strategic and integrated manner in accordance with the Union's Integrated Maritime Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy and international commitments.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities carried out within the Future Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagships on Graphene, the Human Brain Project and Quantum Technology, which are supported under Horizon 2020, will continue to be supported under Horizon Europe through calls for proposals included in the work programme. Preparatory actions supported under the FET Flagships part of Horizon 2020 will feed the strategic planning under Horizon Europe and inform the work on missions, co-funded and/or co-programmed European Partnerships and regular calls for proposals.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Science and technology cooperation dialogues with the Union's international partners and policy dialogues with the main regions of the world shall make important contributions to the systematic identification of opportunities for cooperation which, when combined with differentiation by country and/or region, shall support priority-setting. Early advice from the ERA-related advisory structure will continue to be sought.</p>
            <p id="d1e89-15-1" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">DISSEMINATION AND COMMUNICATION</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Horizon Europe will provide dedicated support for open access to scientific publications, to knowledge repositories and other data sources. Dissemination and knowledge-diffusion actions will be supported, also from cooperation with other Union programmes, including clustering and packaging results and data in languages and formats for target audiences and networks for citizens, industry, public administrations, academia, civil society organisations and policy makers. For this purpose, Horizon Europe may make use of advanced technologies and intelligence tools.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">There will be appropriate support for mechanisms, such as National Contact Points, for the communication of Horizon Europe to potential applicants.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will also implement information and communication activities relating to Horizon Europe, to promote the fact that results were obtained with the support of Union funding. They will also seek to raise public awareness of the importance of R&amp;I and the broader impact and relevance of Union-funded R&amp;I, for example by means of publications, media relations, events, knowledge repositories, databases, multi-channel platforms, websites or a targeted use of social media. Horizon Europe will provide support to the beneficiaries to communicate their work and its impact to society at large.</p>
            <p id="d1e100-15-1" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">EXPLOITATION AND MARKET UPTAKE</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will establish comprehensive measures for the exploitation of Horizon Europe results and the knowledge produced. This will accelerate exploitation towards wide market uptake and boost the impact of Horizon Europe.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will systematically identify and record the results of the R&amp;I activities under Horizon Europe and transfer or disseminate those results and the knowledge produced in a non-discriminatory fashion to industry and enterprises of all sizes, public administrations, academia, civil society organisations and policy-makers, in order to maximise the Union-added value of Horizon Europe.</p>
            <p id="d1e109-15-1" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Greater impact will be achieved through aligning actions with other countries and regions of the world within the framework of strengthened international cooperation efforts. Based on mutual benefit, partners from across the world will be invited to join Union efforts as an integral part of initiatives in support of Union action for sustainability, reinforced R&amp;I excellence and competitiveness.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">International joint action will ensure effective tackling of global societal challenges and SDGs, access to the world's best talent, expertise and resources, and enhanced supply of and demand for innovative solutions.</p>
            <p id="d1e118-15-1" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">WORKING METHODOLOGIES FOR EVALUATION</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The use of high-quality independent expertise in the evaluation process underpins the engagement of the Specific Programme across all stakeholders, communities and interests and is a prerequisite for maintaining the excellence and relevance of the funded activities.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission or funding body will ensure the impartiality of the evaluation process and avoid conflicts of interest in accordance with Article&nbsp;61 of the Financial Regulation. It shall also seek geographical diversity in the composition of evaluation committees as well as of expert and advisory groups.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Exceptionally, when justified by the requirement to appoint the best available experts and/or by the limited size of the pool of qualified experts, independent experts assisting or being members of the evaluation committee may evaluate specific proposals for which they declare a potential interest. In that case, the Commission or funding body shall take all necessary remedial measures to ensure the integrity of the evaluation process. The evaluation process will be managed accordingly, including a stage involving an interaction between diverse experts. The evaluation committee will take into account the particular circumstances when identifying proposals for funding.</p>
            <p id="d1e129-15-1" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">PILLAR I</p>
            <p id="LI2021167EN.01001501-g-008-0008" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">EXCELLENT SCIENCE</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Scientific, economic, social and cultural progress in all its forms depends on an adequate supply of excellent researchers, the search for breakthroughs in understanding and the acquisition of knowledge at all levels, world-class facilities, including physical and knowledge infrastructures for R&amp;I, and the means to openly disseminate and share knowledge ('open science'), methodologies and skills.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The achievement of world-leading innovation is linked to the advancements of open and excellent science. Scientific and technological paradigm shifts can be key drivers for productivity growth, competitiveness, wealth, sustainable development and social progress. Historically, such paradigm shifts have tended to originate from the public-sector science base, before going on to lay the foundations for whole new industries and sectors and for comprehensive societal progress.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Public investment in research, especially through universities and public research institutions and research facilities, often undertakes longer-term, higher-risk research and complements the activities of the private sector. In addition, it creates highly skilled human resources, knowhow and experience, new scientific instruments and methodologies, as well as the networks which transmit the latest knowledge.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">European science and European-based researchers have been and continue to be at the forefront in many areas. However, this is not a position we can take for granted. The traditional challenge from countries such as the United States is now being joined by economic giants such as China and India, from the newly industrialising parts of the world in particular and from all countries where governments recognise the manifold and abundant returns which derive from investing in research.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e145-15-1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e153-15-1">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Although the Union remains the largest producer of scientific publications in the world, it has, relative to its size, comparatively few centres of excellence that stand out at global level and with large areas of average and poor performance. Compared with the United States and now to some degree with China, the Union follows a 'distributed excellence model' in which resources are spread across a larger number of researchers and research institutions. Creating attractive conditions for the best researchers will help Europe to increase its attractiveness in terms of global competition for scientific talent.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The global research landscape is evolving dramatically and becoming increasingly multipolar as a result of a growing number of emerging countries, in particular China, expanding their scientific production. So whereas the Union and the United States accounted for nearly two-thirds of world expenditure on R&amp;D in&nbsp;2000, that share had fallen to less than half by 2013.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The ERC supports the best researchers, including talented researchers who are at an early stage of their career, with flexible, long-term funding to pursue ground-breaking, high-gain and high-risk research, primarily in Europe. It operates autonomously and is led by an independent ERC Scientific Council made up of scientists, engineers and scholars of the highest repute and appropriate expertise and diversity. The ERC is able to draw on a wider pool of talents and ideas than would be possible for any national scheme, reinforcing excellence through the way in which the best researchers and the best ideas compete with each other.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Frontier research funded by the ERC has a proven substantial direct impact in the form of advances at the frontiers of knowledge, opening the way to new and often unexpected scientific and technological results and new areas for research. In turn, this generates radically new ideas which drive innovation and business inventiveness and tackle societal challenges. The ERC also has a significant structural impact, improving the quality of the European research system over and above the researchers and actions it funds directly. ERC-funded actions and researchers set an inspirational target for frontier research in Europe, raising its profile and making it more attractive for the best researchers worldwide to work with and as a place to work. The prestige of hosting ERC grant-holders creates competition between Europe's universities and research organisations to offer the most attractive conditions for top researchers and can indirectly help them to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses and bring about reform.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The ERC funds a relatively small percentage of all European research, but achieves a high scientific impact from the research it funds. The average citation impact of the research supported by the ERC is comparable to that of the world's top elite research universities. The ERC's research performance is extremely high when compared with the world's largest research funders. The ERC funds a great deal of frontier research in many of the research areas that have received the highest numbers of citations, including those areas that are rapidly emerging. Although ERC funding is targeted towards frontier research it has resulted in a substantial number of patents.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">There is therefore clear evidence that the ERC attracts and funds excellent researchers through its calls, and that ERC actions are producing a substantial number of the most significant and high impact research findings worldwide in emerging areas leading to breakthroughs and major advances. The work of ERC grantees is also highly interdisciplinary and ERC grantees collaborate internationally and publish their results openly across all fields of research including the social sciences, the arts and the humanities.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">There is also already evidence of the longer term impact of ERC grants on careers, on training highly skilled recognised researchers and holders of doctoral degrees, on raising the global visibility and prestige of European research and on national research systems through its strong benchmarking effect. This effect is particularly valuable in the Union's distributed excellence model, because ERC-funded status can replace recognition based on the status of institutions and serve as a more accurate indicator of research quality. This allows ambitious individuals, institutions, regions and countries to seize the initiative and scale up the research profiles in which they are particularly strong.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e175-15-1">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of intervention</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e183-15-1">1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frontier Science</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Research funded by the ERC is expected to lead to advances at the frontier of knowledge, with scientific publications of the highest quality achieving research results with high societal and economic potential impact and with the ERC setting a clear and inspirational target for frontier research across the Union, Europe and internationally. Aiming to make the Union a more attractive environment for the world's best scientists, the ERC will aim to make a measurable improvement in the Union's share of top 1&nbsp;% of most highly cited publications globally and to increase the number of excellent researchers which it funds, including from outside Europe.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">ERC funding shall be awarded in accordance with the following well-established principles. Scientific excellence shall be the sole criterion on which ERC grants are awarded. The ERC shall operate on a 'bottom-up' basis without predetermined priorities.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e386-15-1">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Europe needs a highly-skilled and resilient human capital base in R&amp;I that can easily adapt to and find sustainable solutions for current and future challenges, such as major demographic changes in Europe. To ensure excellence, researchers need to be mobile, collaborate and diffuse knowledge across countries, sectors and disciplines, with the right combination of knowledge and skills to tackle societal challenges and to support innovation.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Europe is a scientific powerhouse with around 1,8 million researchers working in thousands of universities, research centres and companies. However, it is estimated that the Union will need to train and employ at least one million new researchers by 2027 in order to achieve the targets being set for increased investment in R&amp;I. That need is particularly acute beyond the academic sector (such as in industry and business, including SMEs, government, civil society organisations, cultural institutions, hospitals etc.) and requires collaboration between the different sectors to provide adequately trained new researchers. The Union must reinforce its efforts to entice more young women and men to a career in research, be more inclusive and promote a better balance between work and family life, attract researchers from third countries, retain its own researchers and reintegrate European researchers working elsewhere back to Europe. In addition, in order to spread excellence more widely, the conditions under which researchers work must be further improved throughout the ERA. In this respect, stronger links are needed in particular with the European Education Area, the ERDF and ESF+.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">These challenges can best be addressed at Union level due to their systemic nature and to the cross-country effort needed to solve them.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The MSCA focus on excellent research that is fully bottom-up, and are open to any field of R&amp;I from basic research up to market take-up and innovation services. This includes research fields covered under the TFEU and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). If specific needs arise and additional funding sources become available, the MSCA may seek links to certain activities related to specific challenges, including identified missions, types of R&amp;I institutions, or geographical locations, in order to respond to the evolution of Europe's requirements in terms of skills, research training, career development and knowledge sharing.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The MSCA are the main instrument at Union level for attracting researchers from third countries to Europe, thus making a major contribution to global cooperation in R&amp;I. Evidence shows that the MSCA not only have a positive impact on individuals, organisations, and at system level, but also yield high-impact and breakthrough research results while at the same time contributing significantly to societal as well as strategic challenges. Long-term investment in people pays off, as indicated by the number of Nobel Prize winners who have been either former MSCA fellows or supervisors.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Through global research competition between scientists and between host organisations from both the academic and non-academic sectors and through the creation and sharing of high-quality knowledge across countries, sectors and disciplines, the MSCA contribute in particular to the goals of the 'Jobs, growth and investment' agenda, the EU Global Strategy and to the SDGs.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The MSCA contribute to making the ERA more effective, competitive and attractive on a global scale. This is achieved by focusing on a new generation of highly-skilled researchers and providing support for emerging talent from across the Union and beyond including by:</p>

This can be achieved by working according to the open science principle which leads to better dissemination, exploitation and diffusion of knowledge and practices. Citizen science could also play a valuable role.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e538-15-1">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">State of the art research infrastructures provide key services to R&amp;I communities, playing an essential role in extending the frontiers of knowledge and laying the basis for R&amp;I contributions to tackle global challenges and industrial competitiveness. Supporting research infrastructures at the Union level helps to mitigate scattered national and regional research infrastructures and pockets of scientific excellence, thereby strengthening the ERA as well as increasing the circulation of knowledge across silos. Scientific progress is increasingly dependent on the collaborations of research infrastructures and industry that develop the necessary instruments based on new key enabling technologies and other new technologies.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The overall aim is to endow Europe with world-class sustainable research infrastructures open and accessible to all researchers in Europe and beyond, which fully exploit their potential for scientific advance and innovation. Key objectives are to reduce the fragmentation of the R&amp;I ecosystem, avoiding duplication of effort, and to better coordinate the design, development, accessibility and use of research infrastructures, including those financed from the ERDF. It is crucial to support open access to research infrastructures for all European researchers as well as to increase access to digital research resources, including through the European Open Science Cloud (the 'EOSC'), specifically stimulating the up-take of open science and open data practises.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">It is also important to improve the long-term sustainability of research infrastructures as they are typically operational for several decades and therefore should produce plans to secure continuous and stable support.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Equally, the Union needs to tackle the rapid increase of global competition for talent by attracting third country researchers to work with European world-class research infrastructures. Increasing the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of European industry is also a major objective, supporting key technologies and services relevant for research infrastructures and their users, thus improving the conditions for supply of innovative solutions.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Past framework programmes have made a significant contribution to the more efficient and effective use of national research infrastructures, and have also developed with the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy-making on pan-European research infrastructures. This strategic approach has generated clear advantages, including reducing duplication of effort with more efficient overall use of resources, as well as standardising processes and procedures. Research mobility plays an important role in facilitating the use of research infrastructures, and therefore synergies with national and European mobility schemes must be considered.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Union-supported activity will provide added value through: consolidating and optimising the existing research infrastructure landscape in Europe alongside efforts to develop new research infrastructures of pan-European importance and impact; ensuring similar sets of research infrastructures work together to address strategic issues affecting user communities; establishing the EOSC as an effective scalable and sustainable environment for data-driven research; the interconnection of national and regional research and education networks, enhancing and securing high-capacity network infrastructure for massive amounts of data and access to digital resources across borders and domain boundaries; promoting the pan-European coverage of distributed research infrastructures, among other things to enable cross-country comparison of research data, for example in the SSH and environmental fields; fostering the interoperability of research infrastructures; enhancing and reinforcing knowledge transfer and training of high-skilled human resources; fostering the use and, where relevant, upgrading of existing world-class pan-European research infrastructures across Horizon Europe; overcoming barriers preventing the best research teams from accessing the best research infrastructures services in Europe; and fostering the innovation potential of research infrastructures, focused on technology development and co-innovation as well as increased use of research infrastructures by industry.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In addition, the international dimension of European research infrastructures must be reinforced, fostering stronger cooperation with international counterparts and international participation in European research infrastructures for mutual benefit.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will contribute to different SDGs such as: SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being; SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 13 – Climate Action.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The establishment, operation and long-term sustainability of research infrastructures identified by ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures of pan-European relevance is essential for the Union to ensure a leading position in frontier research, training and upskilling of researchers, the creation and use of knowledge and the competitiveness of its industries.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The EOSC should become an effective and comprehensive delivery channel for research infrastructures services and should provide Europe's research communities with the next generation of data services for harvesting, storing, processing (for example analytics, simulation, visualisation services) and sharing Big Data from science according to the FAIR principles. The EOSC should also provide researchers in Europe with access to the majority of data generated and collected by research infrastructures as well as to High Performance Computing (HPC) and exascale resources, including those deployed under the European Data Infrastructure (EDI)&nbsp;<a id="ntc1-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0001" href="#ntr1-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0001">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">1</span>)</a>.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The pan-European research and education network will link together and enable remote access to research infrastructures and research resources, by providing interconnectivity between universities, research institutes and R&amp;I communities at Union level as well as international connections to other partner networks worldwide.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The Union is confronted by many challenges, some of which are also global challenges. The scale and complexity of the problems are vast, and in order to find solutions they need to be tackled jointly at Union level and met by adequate, properly trained and skilled human resources, by the appropriate amount of financial resources and by a proportionate effort. It is precisely in this area, of the search for solutions that the Union must work together and be smart, flexible and joined-up, for the benefit and well-being of all our citizens.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Greater impact can be obtained through aligning actions with other nations and regions of the world within international cooperation, along the lines indicated by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. Based on mutual benefit, partners from across the world will be invited to join Union efforts as an integral part of R&amp;I for sustainable development.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">R&amp;I is a key driver of sustainable and inclusive growth and technological and industrial competitiveness. It will contribute to finding solutions to today's problems and those of tomorrow, in order to reverse as quickly as possible the negative and dangerous trend that currently links economic development with the increasing use of natural resources and increasing social challenges. This will turn the challenges into new business opportunities and into rapid benefits for society.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union will benefit as both user and producer of knowledge, technologies and industries, showcasing how modern industrialised, sustainable, inclusive, creative, resilient, open and democratic society and economy can function and develop. The growing economic, environmental and social examples of the sustainable economy of the future will be fostered and boosted, be they for: health and well-being for all; resilient, creative and inclusive societies; societies strengthened by civil security; available clean energy and mobility; a digitised economy and society; a transdisciplinary and creative industry; space-related, marine or land-based solutions; a well-functioning bioeconomy, including food and nutrition solutions; or sustainable use of natural resources, protection of the environment, climate change mitigation and adaptation. These elements of the sustainable economy will all generate wealth in Europe and offer higher quality jobs. Industrial transformation will be crucial, as well as developing Union innovative industrial value chains.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">New technologies affect virtually all policy areas. For each separate technology there is often a combination of social and economic opportunities, such as opportunities for efficiency, quality and improvement of the government and consequences for employment and education, but also possible risks for safety, privacy and ethics. Technology policy therefore requires an integral weighing of interests, and cross-sectoral cooperation and strategy formulation.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">R&amp;I under this pillar of Horizon Europe is grouped into integrated, non-siloed broad clusters of activities. Rather than addressing sectors, the investments aim to achieve systemic changes for our society and economy along a sustainability vector. Such changes will only be achieved if all actors, both private and public, engage in co-designing and co-creating R&amp;I, bringing together end-users, scientists, technology experts, producers, innovators, businesses, educators, policy-makers, citizens and civil society organisations. Therefore, none of the clusters is intended for only one set of actors, and all activities will be implemented primarily by collaborative R&amp;I projects selected on the basis of competitive calls for proposals.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In addition to addressing global challenges, activities in the clusters will also develop and apply key enabling and emerging technologies, whether or not digital-based, as part of a common strategy to promote the Union's industrial and social leadership. Where appropriate, this will use Union space-enabled data and services. All Technology Readiness Levels up to 8 will be covered by this pillar of Horizon Europe without prejudice to Union competition law.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Actions will generate new knowledge, develop technological and non-technological solutions, bring technology from lab to market, develop applications including pilot lines and demonstrators, and include measures to stimulate market uptake and boost private sector commitment to and incentives for standardisation within the Union. Technologies require a critical mass of European researchers and industry to establish world-leading eco-systems that include state-of-the-art technology infrastructures for example for testing. Synergies with other parts of Horizon Europe and the EIT, as well as with other programmes, will be maximised.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The clusters will boost the quick introduction of first-of-its-kind innovation in the Union through a broad range of embedded activities, including communication, dissemination, exploitation and standardisation, as well as support to non-technological innovation and innovative delivery mechanisms, helping to create innovation-friendly societal, regulatory and market conditions such as the innovation deals. Pipelines of innovative solutions originating from R&amp;I actions will be established and targeted at public and private investors, as well as other relevant Union and national or regional programmes. Synergies will be developed with Pillar III of Horizon Europe in that perspective.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Gender equality is a crucial factor in obtaining sustainable economic growth. It is therefore important to integrate a gender perspective in all global challenges.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e685-15-1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLUSTER 'HEALTH'</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e693-15-1">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The European Pillar of Social Rights asserts that everyone has the right to timely access to affordable, preventive and curative health care that is safe and of good quality. This underlines the Union's commitment to the SDGs which call for universal health coverage for all and at all ages by 2030, leaving no-one behind and ending preventable deaths.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">A healthy population is vital for a stable, sustainable and inclusive society, and improvements in health are crucial in reducing poverty, dealing with an ageing European society, fostering social progress and prosperity, and increasing economic growth. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a&nbsp;10&nbsp;% improvement in life expectancy is associated with a rise in economic growth of 0,3-0,4&nbsp;% a year. Average life expectancy in the Union has increased by 12 years since the establishment of the Union, as a result of tremendous improvements in the quality of life, environment, education, health and care of its citizens. In 2015, average life expectancy at birth was 80,6 years in the Union compared to 71,4 years globally. In the past years, this has increased in the Union by an average of 3 months annually. Social and gender-specific differences in life expectancy can be observed between specific groups and across European countries.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Health R&amp;I has played a significant part in this achievement but also in improving productivity and quality in the health and care industry. However, the Union continues to face novel, newly-emerging or persisting challenges that threaten its citizens and public health, the sustainability of its health care and social protection systems, and the competitiveness of its health and care industry. Major health challenges in the Union include: inequalities in access to and affordability of health and care; lack of effective health promotion and disease prevention; rise of non-communicable diseases; increased cases of cancer; increase in mental illness; the spread of antimicrobial drug-resistance and the emergence of infectious disease epidemics; increased environmental pollution; persistence of health inequalities among and within countries disproportionally affecting people that are disadvantaged or in vulnerable stages of life; detection, understanding, control, prevention and mitigation of health risks, including poverty-related aspects, in rapidly-changing social, urban, rural and natural environments; demographic change, including ageing-related issues, and the increasing costs for European health care systems; and the increasing pressure on the European health and care industry to remain competitive in and by developing health innovation vis-a-vis emerging global players. In addition, vaccine hesitancy may decrease immunisation coverage among certain population groups.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">These health challenges are complex, interlinked and global in nature and require multidisciplinary, technical and non-technical, cross-sectorial and transnational collaborations. R&amp;I activities will build close connections between fundamental, translational, clinical, epidemiological, ethical, environmental and socio-economic research, as well as with regulatory sciences. They will address areas of unmet clinical needs such as rare or hard-to-treat diseases (including cancers such as paediatric and lung cancer). These activities will harness the combined skills of academics, practitioners, regulatory bodies and industry, and foster their collaboration with health services, social services, patients, policy-makers and citizens in order to leverage public funding and ensure the uptake of results in clinical practice as well as in health care systems, taking into account the competencies of Member States regarding the organisation and financing of their health systems. Full advantage will be taken of genomic and other multiomics frontier research, as well as the progressive introduction of personalised medicine approaches, relevant for addressing a variety of non-communicable diseases and the digitalisation in health and care.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">R&amp;I will foster strategic collaboration at Union and international level in order to pool the expertise, capacities and resources needed to create scope, speed and economies of scale, as well as to exploit synergies, avoid duplication of effort and share the expected benefits and financial risks involved. Synergies in health R&amp;I in Horizon Europe shall be promoted, in particular with the EU4Health Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/522 of the European Parliament and of the Council&nbsp;<a id="ntc2-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0002" href="#ntr2-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0002">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">2</span>)</a>.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Digital health solutions have created many opportunities to solve the problems of care services and to address other emerging issues of an ageing society. Full advantage should be taken of the opportunities that digitalisation in health and care can provide without jeopardising the right to privacy and data protection. Digital devices and software have been developed to diagnose, treat and facilitate patients' self-management of illness, including chronic diseases. Digital technologies are also increasingly used in medical training and education and to enable patients and other healthcare consumers to access, share and create health information.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The R&amp;I activities of this cluster will develop the knowledge base, exploit existing knowledge and technologies, consolidate and create the R&amp;I capacity and develop the solutions needed for a more effective promotion of health and the integrated prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, rehabilitation and cure of diseases and long-term and palliative care. Results of research will be translated as recommendations for action and communicated to the relevant stakeholders. Improving health outcomes will in turn result in increased well-being and life expectancy, healthy active lives, improved quality of life and productivity, more healthy life years and sustainability of health and care systems. In accordance with Articles 18 and&nbsp;19 of Regulation (EU) 2021/695 and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ethics, protection of human dignity, gender and ethnical aspects and the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable people will receive special attention.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Addressing major health challenges will support the Union's commitment to the United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its commitment in the context of other UN organisations and international initiatives, including the global strategies and plans of action of the World Health Organization (WHO). Addressing such challenges will contribute to the Union's policy goals and strategies, notably to the European Pillar of Social Rights, the Union's Digital Single Market, the Union's Cross-border Healthcare, and the European One Health Action Plan against antimicrobial resistance, and to the implementation of the relevant Union regulatory frameworks.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will contribute directly to the following SDGs in particular: SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being; SDG13 – Climate Action.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e729-15-1">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of Intervention</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e737-15-1">1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health throughout the Life Course</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">People in vulnerable stages of life (perinatal, birth, infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, mature and late adulthood), including people with disabilities or injuries, have specific health needs that require better understanding and tailored solutions, taking gender and ethical aspects into consideration. This will enable the reduction of related health inequalities and the improvement of health outcomes, facilitating active and healthy ageing throughout the life course, including through a healthy start to life and a lifelong healthy diet which reduces the risk of mental and physical diseases later in life. Prevention and communication will consider the characteristics of specific audiences.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Health technologies and tools are vital for public health and have contributed to a large extent to the important improvements achieved in the quality of life, health and care of people in the Union. It is a key strategic challenge to design, develop, deliver, implement and evaluate suitable, trustworthy, safe, user-friendly and cost-effective tools and technologies for health and care, taking due account of the needs of people with disabilities and the aging society. These include key enabling technologies from new biomaterials to biotechnology as well as single cell methods, multiomics and systems medicine approaches, artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies, offering significant improvements over existing technologies, as well as stimulating a competitive and sustainable health-related industry that creates high-value jobs. The European health-related industry is a critical economic sector in the Union, accounting for 3&nbsp;% of gross domestic product (GDP) and&nbsp;1,5 million employees. Relevant stakeholders need to be involved as early as possible, and the non-technological dimension taken into account, in order to ensure acceptability of new technologies, methodologies and tools. These stakeholders include citizens, informal health care providers and health care professionals.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e967-15-1">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union stands for a unique way of combining economic growth with SDGs and social policies, with high levels of social inclusion and shared values embracing democracy, human rights, gender equality and the richness of diversity. This model is constantly evolving and needs to deal with the challenges from, among other things, globalisation, technological change and rising inequalities.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union must promote a model of inclusive and sustainable growth while reaping the benefits of technological advancements, enhancing trust in and promoting innovation of democratic governance, fostering education, combatting inequalities, unemployment, marginalisation, discrimination and radicalisation, guaranteeing human rights, fostering cultural diversity and European cultural heritage and empowering citizens through social innovation. The management of migration and the integration of migrants will also continue to be priority issues. The role of R&amp;I in social sciences, humanities, and arts, as well as in the cultural and creative sectors, in responding to these challenges and achieving the Union's goals is fundamental. In particular SSH aspects are included in all intervention areas of this cluster.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The magnitude, the complexity and the intergenerational and transnational character of the challenges call for multi-layered Union action. Addressing such critical social, political, cultural and economic issues only at national level would carry the danger of inefficient use of resources, fragmented approaches and dissimilar standards of knowledge and capacity.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">R&amp;I activities in this cluster will be overall aligned with the Union's priorities on Democratic Change; Jobs, Growth and Investment; Justice and Fundamental Rights; Migration; A Deeper and Fairer European Monetary Union; Digital Single Market. They will respond to the commitment of the Rome Agenda to work towards 'a social Europe' and 'a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and promotes cultural diversity'. It will also support the European Pillar of Social Rights, and the Global Compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.

            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will contribute directly to the following SDGs in particular: SDG 1 – No Poverty; SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being; SDG 4 – Quality Education; SDG 5 – Gender Equality; SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 10 – Reducing Inequalities; SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1015-15-1">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of Intervention</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1023-15-1">2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy and Governance</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Trust in democracy and established political institutions seems to be receding. Disenchantment with politics is increasingly articulated by anti-establishment and populist parties and a resurgent nativism. This is compounded by socio-economic inequalities, high migration flows and security concerns, among others. Responding to present and future challenges requires new thinking on how democratic institutions at all levels must adapt in a context of greater diversity, global economic competition, rapid technological advancements and digitisation, with citizens' experience of democratic discourses, practices and institutions being crucial.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The European cultural and creative sectors build bridges between arts, culture, spiritual beliefs and experiences and cultural heritage, business and technology. Furthermore, cultural and creative industries play a key role in reindustrialising Europe, are a driver for growth and are in a strategic position to trigger innovative spill-overs in other industrial sectors, such as tourism, retail, media and digital technologies and engineering. Cultural heritage forms an integral part of the cultural and creative sectors and is the fabric of our lives, meaningful to communities, groups and societies, giving a sense of belonging. It is the bridge between the past and the future of our societies. A better understanding of our cultural heritage and how it is perceived and interpreted is vital to creating an inclusive society in Europe and worldwide. It is also a driving force of European, national, regional and local economies and a powerful source of inspiration for creative and cultural industries. Accessing, conserving, safeguarding and restoring, interpreting and harnessing the full potential of our cultural heritage are crucial challenges now and for future generations. Cultural heritage, tangible and intangible, is the major input and inspiration for the arts, traditional craftsmanship, the cultural, creative and entrepreneurial sectors that are drivers of sustainable economic growth, new job creation and external trade. In this sense, both innovation and resilience of cultural heritage need to be considered in collaboration with local communities and relevant stakeholders. Cultural heritage may also serve as an agent of cultural diplomacy and as a factor of identity building and cultural and social cohesion.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1182-15-1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLUSTER 'CIVIL SECURITY FOR SOCIETY'</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1190-15-1">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">European cooperation has contributed to an era of unprecedented peace, stability and prosperity on the European continent. However, Europe must respond to the challenges arising from persistent threats to the security of our increasingly complex and digitalised society. Terrorist attacks and radicalisation, as well as cyber-attacks and hybrid threats, raise major security concerns and put particular strain on societies. New, emerging security threats caused by new technologies of the near future also require attention. Future security and prosperity depend on improving the ability to protect Europe against such threats. These cannot be dealt with purely by technological means, but require knowledge about people, their history, culture and behaviour, and include ethical considerations regarding the balance between security and freedom. Moreover, Europe must ensure its non-dependence on security-critical technologies and support the development of breakthrough security technologies.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">European citizens, state institutions, Union bodies and the economy need to be protected from the continued threats of terrorism and organised crime, including firearms trafficking, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings and of cultural goods. Human and social dimensions of criminality and violent radicalisation require better understanding so as to improve public policies in terms of security. Strengthening protection and security through better border management, including maritime and land borders, is also key. Cybercrime is on the increase and related risks are diversifying as the economy and society digitalise. Europe needs to continue its efforts to improve cybersecurity, digital privacy, personal data protection and combat the spread of false and harmful information in order to safeguard democratic, social and economic stability. Further efforts are required to limit the effects on lives and livelihoods of extreme weather events which are intensifying due to climate change, such as floods, storms, heat waves or droughts leading to forest fires and land degradation, as well as other natural disasters, such as earthquakes. Disasters, whether natural or human-made, can put at risk important societal functions and critical infrastructures, such as communication, health, food, drinking water, energy supply, transport, security and government.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">This cluster requires both technical research and research into the human factors involved in improving disaster resilience including, where appropriate, testing applications, training and cyber hygiene and education. More efforts are needed to evaluate the results of security research and promote their uptake.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">This cluster will seek synergies, in particular with the following programmes: Internal Security Fund, Integrated Border Management Fund and the Digital Europe Programme. It will also seek improved R&amp;I cooperation between intergovernmental agencies and organisations including through exchange and consultation mechanisms, for example in the intervention area 'Protection and Security'.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Security research is part of the wider comprehensive Union response to security threats. It contributes to the capability development process by enabling the future availability of technologies, techniques and applications to fill capability gaps identified by policy-makers and practitioners and civil society organisations. Already, funding to research through the Union's previous framework programme has represented around 50&nbsp;% of total public funding for security research in the Union. Full use will be made of available instruments, including the Union Space Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/696 of the European Parliament and of the Council&nbsp;<a id="ntc7-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0007" href="#ntr7-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0007">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">7</span>)</a> (EGNOS and Galileo, Copernicus, Space Situational Awareness and Governmental Satellite Communications). Whereas R&amp;I activities under the Specific Programme will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with Union-funded defence research will be sought in order to strengthen synergies, recognising that there are areas of dual-use technology. Duplication of funding is avoided. Cross-border collaboration contributes to developing a European single security market and improving industrial performance, underpinning the Union's autonomy. Due attention will be given to the human understanding and perception of security.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Security research responds to the commitment of the Rome Agenda to work towards 'a safe and secure Europe', contributing to a genuine and effective Security Union.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will contribute directly to the following SDG in particular: SDG 16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1222-15-1">3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disaster-Resilient Societies</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Disasters may arise from multiple sources, whether natural or human-made, including those from terrorist attacks, climate-related and other extreme events (including from rising sea levels). Those sources include in particular forest fires, heat waves, floods, droughts, desertification, earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic events, water crises, space weather events, industrial and transport disasters, and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) events, as well as those from resulting cascading risks. The aim is to prevent and reduce the loss of life, harm to health and the environment, trauma, and economic and material damage caused by disasters, as well as to ensure food, medicine supply and services and water security, in addition to improving the understanding and reduction of disaster risks and enhancing post-disaster recovery. This implies covering the full spectrum of crisis management: from prevention and training to crisis management and post-crisis management and resilience.</p>

Cyber threats are often criminal, motivated by profit, but they can also be political and strategic. Our future security, freedom, democracy and prosperity depend on improving our ability to protect the Union against cyber threats. The digital transformation requires improving cybersecurity substantially, to ensure the protection of the huge number of Internet of Things devices expected to be connected to the internet and the safe operation of network and information systems, including for power grids, drinking water supply and distribution, vehicles and transport systems, hospitals, finances, public institutions, factories and homes. Europe must build resilience to cyber-attacks and create effective cyber deterrence, while making sure that data protection and the freedom of citizens are strengthened. It is in the Union's interest to ensure that it develops and retains essential cybersecurity strategic capacities in order to secure the Digital Single Market and, in particular, to ensure the protection of critical networks and information systems and to provide key cybersecurity services. The Union must be in a position to autonomously secure its digital assets and to compete on the global cybersecurity market.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1330-15-1">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">To ensure industrial competitiveness and the capacity to address the global challenges ahead, the Union must increase its technological sovereignty and its scientific, technological and industrial capacities in the key areas that underpin the transformation of our economy, the work place and society.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Union industry provides one out of five jobs and two thirds of private sector R&amp;D investments in the Union and generates 80&nbsp;% of Union exports. A new wave of innovation, involving a merging of physical and digital technologies, will trigger huge opportunities for Union industry and improve the quality of life for Union citizens.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Digitisation is a major driver. As it continues at a rapid pace across all sectors, investment in priority areas ranging from trustworthy AI to next generation internet, high performance computing, photonics, quantum technologies, micro-electronics or nano-electronics and robotics becomes essential for the strength of our economy and the sustainability of our society. Investing, producing and using digital technologies provides a major boost to Union economic growth, amounting to an increase of 30&nbsp;% of the Union's GDP between&nbsp;2001 and&nbsp;2011. In this context, the role of SMEs remains fundamental in the Union, both in terms of growth and jobs. Digital uptake among SMEs promotes competitiveness and sustainability.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Key enabling technologies&nbsp;<a id="ntc8-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0008" href="#ntr8-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0008">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">8</span>)</a> underpin the blending of the digital and the physical worlds, central to this new global wave of innovation. Investing in research, development, demonstration and deployment of key enabling technologies, and ensuring a secure, sustainable and affordable supply of raw and advanced materials, will secure Union strategic autonomy and help Union industry to significantly reduce its carbon and environmental footprints.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Specific future and emerging technologies will also be pursued as appropriate.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Space is of strategic importance; around 10&nbsp;% of the Union's GDP depends on the use of space services. The Union has a world-class space sector, with a strong satellite manufacturing industry and a dynamic downstream services sector. Space provides important tools for monitoring, communication, navigation and surveillance and opens up many business opportunities, especially in combination with digital technologies and other sources of data. The Union must make the most of these opportunities by fully exploiting the potential of its space programmes Copernicus, EGNOS and Galileo, and by protecting space and ground infrastructures against threats from space.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union has the unique possibility of being a global leader and increasing its share of world markets, by showcasing how digital transformation, leadership in key enabling and space technologies, the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy and competitiveness can reinforce each other through scientific and technological excellence.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">To make the digitised, circular, low-carbon and low-emission economy a reality, action is needed at Union level because of the complexity of value chains, the systemic and multi-disciplinary nature of the technologies and their high development costs, and the cross-sectoral nature of the problems to be addressed. The Union must ensure that all industrial players, and society at large, can benefit from advanced and clean technologies and digitalisation. Developing technologies alone will not suffice. A societal understanding of these technologies and evolutions is crucial for engaging end users and generating behavioural change.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Industrially-oriented infrastructures, including pilot lines, will help Union businesses, and in particular SMEs, deploy these technologies and improve their innovation performance and may also be facilitated by other Union programmes.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">A strong engagement of industry and civil society is essential for setting priorities and developing R&amp;I agendas, increasing the leverage of public funding through private and public investments, and ensuring a better uptake of results. Societal understanding and acceptance, including consideration of the design of products, goods and services, are key ingredients for success, along with a new agenda for industry-relevant skills and standardisation.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Bringing together activities on digital, key enabling and space technologies, as well as a sustainable supply of raw materials, will allow for a more systemic approach, and a faster and more profound digital and industrial transformation. It will ensure that R&amp;I in these areas feed into, and contribute to, the implementation of the Union's policies for industry, digitisation, environment, energy and climate, circular economy, raw and advanced materials and space.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Complementarity will be ensured with activities under other Union programmes, and in particular the Digital Europe Programme and the Union Space Programme, while respecting the delineation between programmes and avoiding overlaps.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will contribute directly to the following SDGs in particular: SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG – 13 Climate Action.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Manufacturing is a key driver of employment and prosperity in the Union, producing over three quarters of the Union's global exports and providing over a&nbsp;100 million direct and indirect jobs. The key challenge for Union manufacturing is to remain competitive at a global level with smarter and more customised products of high added value, produced at much lower energy and material resource costs as well as with a reduced carbon and environmental footprint. Creative and cultural inputs as well as perspectives from social sciences and humanities on the relation between technology and people in production will be vital to help generate added value. The impact on work life and employment will be studied as well.</p>

Researchers and innovators developing AI and offering applications in robotics and other areas will be key drivers of future economic and productivity growth. Many sectors including health, manufacturing, ship-building, construction, service industries and farming will use and further develop this key enabling technology in other parts of Horizon Europe. AI developments must be conducted openly across the Union, ensure the safety and societal and environmental soundness of AI-based applications, and consider ethical aspects from the outset, as well as assessing the risks and mitigating its potential for malicious use and unintended discrimination such as gender, racial or disability bias. AI must be developed within a well-coordinated framework which respects the Union's values, ethical principles and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Horizon Europe will be complemented by activities set out under the Digital Europe Programme.</p>

Activities will be generally roadmap-based, taking account of the European Space Agency (ESA) harmonisation process and relevant Member State initiatives, and will be implemented with ESA and the European Union Agency for the Space Programme, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/696. However, the space part of this cluster will also support bottom-up calls to allow the emergence of future space technologies.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1690-15-1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLUSTER 'CLIMATE, ENERGY AND MOBILITY'</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1698-15-1">5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The intersection of R&amp;I on climate, energy and mobility will address in a highly integrated and effective way one of the most important global challenges for the sustainability and future of our environment, economy and way of life.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the Union will need to transition to climate neutral, resource-efficient and resilient economies and societies. This will entail profound changes in technology, processes, products and services, and to the ways in which businesses and consumers behave. Transformation of the energy market will take place through interaction of technology, infrastructure linking the markets, market forces as well as policy and regulatory frameworks, including new forms of governance. Pursuing efforts to limit the global temperature increase to 1,5&nbsp;°C requires rapid progress in decarbonising the energy, transport, buildings, industrial and agriculture sectors. New impetus is needed to accelerate the pace of developing next-generation breakthroughs as well as demonstrating and deploying cost-efficient innovative technologies and solutions, using also the opportunities provided by digital, bio and space technologies, as well as key enabling technologies and advanced materials. This will be pursued through an integrated approach encompassing decarbonisation, resource efficiency, improved recovery, reuse and recycling, reduction of air pollution, access to raw materials and circular economy in Horizon Europe.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Progress in these sectors, but also across the spectrum of Union industry including energy infrastructures, transport, agriculture and forestry, tourism, buildings, industrial processes and product use, waste management and recycling&nbsp;<a id="ntc11-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0011" href="#ntr11-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0011">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">11</span>)</a>, will require continued efforts to better understand the mechanisms and dynamics of climate change and the associated impacts across the economy and society, exploiting synergies with regional and national activities, other Union types of actions and international cooperation, including through mission innovation.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Over recent decades, considerable advances have been made in climate science, in particular in observations, data assimilation and climate modelling. However, the complexity of the climate system and the need to support implementation of the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and Union policies necessitate a reinforced effort to fill the remaining knowledge gaps and to further enhance the spatial and temporal granularity of climate science while ensuring adequate interaction with citizens and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union has established a comprehensive policy framework in the Energy Union strategy, with binding targets, legislative acts and R&amp;I activities aiming to lead in developing and deploying efficient energy production systems based on renewable and alternative energy&nbsp;<a id="ntc12-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0012" href="#ntr12-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0012">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">12</span>)</a>.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Transport, including vehicles, ensures the mobility of people and goods necessary for an integrated European single market, territorial cohesion and an open and inclusive society. At the same time, transport can have significant effects on human health, congestion, land, water, climate, air quality and noise as well as on safety, resulting in numerous premature deaths and increased socio-economic costs. Demand for goods and mobility will continue to grow. Therefore, innovation will have to bridge growing demand with cleaner and more efficient mobility and transport systems that also need to be safe, smart, secure, silent, reliable, accessible, inclusive and affordable, offering a seamless integrated door-to-door service to all.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Both sectors are major drivers of Europe's economic competitiveness and growth. Transport is a fundamental sector for and of the economy with the Union being a world leader in vehicle, rail, aircraft and vessel design and manufacturing. It embraces a complex network of around 1,2 million private and public companies in the Union, employing around 10,5 million people. The sector is also important for the Union's international trade: in&nbsp;2016, 17,2&nbsp;% of the Union's total exports of services were transport-related. At the same time, the Union has over 2 million people working in the field of renewables and energy efficiency, and is in second place worldwide in terms of patenting of innovative clean energy technologies.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The issues faced by the energy and transport sectors go beyond the need for emission reduction. Effective solutions are needed to respond to changes in user behaviour and mobility patterns, globalisation, increasing international competition and an older, more urban and increasingly diverse population. At the same time, the increasing penetration of digital and space-based technologies, automated vehicles, AI, robotics, new market entrants, disruptive business models and the need for increased system resilience against multifaceted hazards (including cyber threats) bring substantive transformation and create challenges and opportunities for the competitiveness of the European transport and energy sectors.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The ability of cities to function will become dependent on technology, and the liveability of cities will evolve around mobility, energy and resource efficiency, spatial planning and competition in space use. Developments will also be posing a challenge to the sustainability of existing social models and social participation, aspects of inclusion and accessibility as well as affordability.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Finding new ways to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy-based and energy efficient technologies (including through intermediate carriers such as power-to-gas and hydrogen) and other non-technological solutions for the decarbonisation of the European economy requires increased demand for innovation. This can be stimulated through the empowerment of citizens and the greening of public procurement, as well as by socio-economic and public sector innovation, and will lead to approaches broader than technology-driven innovation. Socio-economic research covering areas including user needs and patterns, foresight activities, environmental, regulatory, economic, social, cultural and behavioural aspects, business cases and models and pre-normative research for standard-setting and market uptake innovation, will also facilitate actions fostering regulatory, financing and social innovation skills, as well as engagement and empowerment of market players, consumers and citizens. A better coordination, complementarity and synergy between national and European R&amp;I efforts by promoting information exchange and cooperation among Member States, industries and research institutions will build on the achievements of, for example, the SET-Plan and the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA). Complementarity between this cluster and the Union's Emissions Trading System Innovation Fund will be ensured.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities under this cluster contribute in particular to the goals of the Energy Union, the Paris Agreement commitment as well as to those of the Digital Single Market, the Jobs, Growth and Investment agenda, the strengthening of the Union as a global actor, the new Industrial Strategy for Europe, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan, the Circular Economy Action Plan, the European Battery Alliance Initiative, the Raw Materials Initiative, the Security Union and the Urban Agenda, as well as the Common Agricultural Policy of the Union as well as Union legal provisions to reduce noise and air pollution.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will contribute directly to the following SDGs in particular: SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG 13 – Climate Action.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1747-15-1">5.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate Science and Solutions</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Effective implementation of the Paris Agreement must be based on science, requiring continuous improvement of our knowledge on the climate-earth system, as well as the mitigation and adaptations options available, allowing for a systemic and comprehensive picture of challenges and climate-responsible opportunities for the Union's economy and society. On this basis, science-based solutions for a cost-effective transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and resource-efficient society will be developed, considering behavioural, regulatory, socio-economic and governance aspects.</p>

As regards renewable energy technologies, costs need to decrease further, performance must improve, integration into the energy system must be improved, breakthrough technologies need to be developed, in particular to benefit from advances in photonics, and hybrid solutions (such as for desalination) should be explored. As regards fossil fuels, decarbonising their usage is essential in order to meet climate objectives.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The expected growth of variable electricity production and a shift towards more electric heating, cooling and transport dictate the need for new approaches to management of energy grids. In addition to decarbonisation, the goal is to ensure energy affordability, security, climate resilience and stability of supply, achieved through investments in innovative network infrastructure technologies, increased flexibility of dispatchable power generation, in particular from renewable sources, and innovative system management, as well as by facilitating actions fostering regulatory and social innovation, skills, and engaging and empowering market players, consumers and communities. Energy storage in different forms will play a key role in providing services to the grid, and also improve and reinforce network capacities and system flexibility. Exploiting synergies between different networks (such as electricity grids, heating and cooling networks, gas networks, transport recharging and refuelling infrastructure, hydrogen, including its infrastructure, and telecom networks) and actors (such as industrial sites, network operators, data centres, self-producers, consumers and renewable energy communities) as well as demand-response and developing and integrating European and international standards will be crucial for enabling the smart, integrated operation of the relevant infrastructures.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Buildings and industrial facilities play an increasingly active role in their interaction with the energy system. They are crucial elements in the transition to a carbon-neutral society based on renewable energy and increased energy efficiency.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Buildings are an important factor for the quality of life of citizens. Integrating different technologies, appliances and systems and linking various energy uses, buildings, along with their inhabitants and users, represent a very high potential for climate change mitigation, energy generation, energy savings, storage, system flexibility and efficiency improvements.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Industries, and especially those that are energy-intensive, could further improve energy efficiency, reduce their energy consumption and favour the integration of renewable energy sources. The role of industrial facilities in the energy system is changing due to the need to reduce emissions, based on direct or indirect electrification, which is also a source of materials for production processes (such as hydrogen). Industrial and manufacturing complexes where many different processes take place in close proximity can optimise the exchange of flows of energy and other resources (such as raw materials) between them.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Reaching the Union's air quality, climate and energy goals, including net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as improving noise reduction, will require a rethink of the whole mobility system including users' needs and behaviours, vehicles, fuels and infrastructures, as well as new mobility solutions. It will also require the deployment of low-emission alternative energies and market uptake of zero-emission aircrafts, vehicles and vessels. In addition to the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, transport contributes significantly to poor air quality and noise in Europe with negative consequences for the health of citizens and ecosystems. Building on progress made in relation to electrification and the use of batteries and fuel cells for cars, buses and light-duty vehicles, accompanied by adequate standards, it is essential to accelerate R&amp;I as regards low-emission solutions for other road applications (such as long-distance coaches, heavy-freight vehicles and lorries) and other transport sectors such as aviation, rail, maritime and inland navigation. Transport safety research aims to reduce accident rates, fatalities and casualties for each mode of transport and for the whole transport system by furthering knowledge and awareness and by developing technologies, products, services and solutions that reconcile safety, efficiency, user-friendliness and climate change.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e2024-15-1">6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Human activities are exerting increasing pressure on soil, seas and oceans, water, air, biodiversity and other natural resources. Nourishing the planet's growing human population is directly dependent on the health of natural systems and resources. Beyond its intrinsic value, a functioning and prosperous ecosystem is the very basis for all resource utilisation. However, combined with climate change, humankind's growing demand for natural resources creates environmental pressures that go far beyond sustainable levels, affecting ecosystems and their capacity to provide services for human well-being. The concepts of the circular economy, the sustainable bioeconomy&nbsp;<a id="ntc13-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0013" href="#ntr13-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0013">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">13</span>)</a> and the blue economy&nbsp;<a id="ntc14-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0014" href="#ntr14-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0014">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">14</span>)</a> provide an opportunity to balance environmental, social and economic goals and to set human activities on a path to sustainability.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Meeting the goals of sustainable development, guaranteeing the production and consumption of safe and healthy food, promoting sustainable practices in agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry, ensuring access to clean water, soil and air for all, cleaning-up seas, oceans and inland waters, and preserving and restoring the planet's vital natural systems and environment requires that we harness the potential of R&amp;I. However, we do not yet fully understand the pathways for the transition to sustainability and the methods for overcoming resilient barriers. Making the transition to sustainable consumption and production and restoring planetary health requires investment in research and technologies, novel, high quality products and services, new business models, and social, territorial and environmental innovation. This creates new opportunities for a sustainable, resilient, innovative and responsible European bioeconomy, boosting resource efficiency, productivity and competitiveness, generating new and green jobs and growth and increasing social inclusion.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">It is essential for Europe to use its natural resources more efficiently and in a sustainable manner.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will build a knowledge base and deliver solutions to: protect, sustainably manage and use natural resources from land, inland waters and sea, and enhance the role of terrestrial and aquatic systems as carbon sinks; protect biodiversity, secure ecosystem services and ensure food and nutrition security, providing safe, healthy and nutritious diets; accelerate the transition from a fossil-based linear economy to a resource-efficient, resilient, low-emission, low-carbon circular economy, and support the development of a sustainable bioeconomy and the blue economy; and develop resilient and vibrant rural, mountain, coastal and urban areas.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">These activities will help to maintain and enhance biodiversity and secure the long-term provision of ecosystem services, such as climate change adaptation and mitigation and carbon sequestration (on land, inland waters and sea). They will help reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions, waste and pollution from primary production (both terrestrial and aquatic), the use of hazardous substances, processing, consumption and other human activities. They will trigger investment, supporting the shift towards a circular economy, sustainable bioeconomy and blue economy, whilst protecting environmental health and integrity.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will also foster participatory approaches to R&amp;I, including the multi-actor approach and develop knowledge and innovation systems at local, regional, national and European levels. Social innovation with citizens' engagement and trust in innovation will be crucial to encourage new governance, production, consumption patterns and skills.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">As these challenges are complex, interlinked and global in nature, activities will follow a systemic approach, cooperating with Member States and international partners, with other funding sources and with other policy initiatives. This will involve user-driven exploitation of environmental Big Data sources, such as those from Copernicus, EGNOS and Galileo, INSPIRE, EOSC, GEOSS, CEOS and EMODnet.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">R&amp;I activities under this cluster contribute in particular to the implementation of the goals of: the Environment Action Programme, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy, the Food Law legislation, the Maritime Policy, the Circular Economy Action Plan, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan, the Biodiversity Strategy, the 2030 climate and energy framework and the Union 2050 long term vision for carbon neutrality&nbsp;<a id="ntc15-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0015" href="#ntr15-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0015">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">15</span>)</a>, the EU Arctic Policy as well as Union legal provisions that aim to reduce air pollution. Beyond the general sources of external advice, specific consultation will be sought from the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Activities will contribute directly to the following SDGs in particular: SDG 2 – Zero Hunger; SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being; SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG 13 – Climate Action; SDG 14 – Life Below Water; SDG 15 – Life on Land.</p>

Improved spatio-temporal coverage and sampling intervals at reduced cost, as well as Big Data access and integration from multiple sources provide new ways to monitor, understand and predict the Earth system. R&amp;I is needed to develop methods and technologies to improve quality as well as to facilitate access and use of data.</p>

Due account must be taken of potential upstream impact throughout whole value chains. International cooperation and contribution to international efforts and initiatives, such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, are essential to achieve the objectives in this area. There is a need to better understand the governance of the transition to sustainability in the economic, social and natural system, from the local to the global level.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The natural capital and ecosystem services of seas, in particular of semi-closed European seas, oceans, inland waters and wider coastal areas offer significant socio-economic and welfare benefits. This potential is at risk because of the severe pressure from human and natural stressors such as pollution, overfishing, climate change, sea-level rise, other water-use and extreme weather events. To prevent seas and oceans from reaching a point of no return, and to restore the good status of inland waters, it is necessary to strengthen our knowledge and understanding so that we protect, restore and sustainably manage marine, inland and coastal ecosystems and prevent pollution, in a context of an improved and responsible governance framework. This will also include research into how to sustainably unlock the vast and unexploited economic potential of seas, oceans and inland waters with the aim of producing more safe food, bio-based ingredients and raw material without increasing pressures on those seas, oceans and inland waters, as well as research into the potential of aquaculture in all forms to alleviate pressure on land, freshwater and ocean resources. There is a need for partnering approaches, including sea basin and macro-regional strategies, extending beyond the Union (including in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the North Sea, the Black Sea, the Caribbean Sea and the Indian Ocean); and for contributing to International Ocean Governance commitments, initiatives like the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and commitments linked to the conservation of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.</p>

Current food production and consumption are largely unsustainable, and at the same time we are confronted with the double burden of malnutrition, which is characterised by the coexistence of undernutrition, obesity and other diet imbalances and metabolic disorders. Future food systems need to deliver on food security, and ensure sufficient safe, healthy and quality food for all, underpinned by resource efficiency, sustainability (including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, water and energy consumption as well as waste production), transparency, linking land, inland waters and sea, reducing food waste, enhancing food production from inland waters, seas and oceans and encompassing the entire 'food value chain' from producers to consumers, and back again, ensuring resilience. This needs to go hand in hand with development of the food safety system of the future and the design, development and delivery of tools, technologies and digital solutions that provide significant benefits for consumers and improve the competitiveness and sustainability of the food value chain. Furthermore, there is a need to foster behavioural changes in food consumption and production patterns, taking into account cultural and social aspects, as well as to engage primary producers, industry (including SMEs), retailers, food service sectors, consumers and public services.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e2367-15-1">7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">High-quality and trusted scientific evidence is essential for good public policies. New initiatives and proposals for Union legislation need transparent, comprehensive and balanced evidence, whereas implementation of policies needs evidence in order to measure and monitor the impact and progress of those policies.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The JRC adds value to Union policies because its science is excellent, multi-disciplinary and independent of national, private and other external interests. Serving all areas of Union policy, it provides the cross-sectoral support that policymakers need to tackle increasingly complex societal challenges. The JRC's independence from special interests, combined with its scientific-technical reference role, enables it to facilitate consensus-building between stakeholders and other actors such as citizens, and policy makers. With its capacity to respond rapidly to policy needs, the JRC's activities are complementary with indirect actions that support longer-term policy objectives.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The JRC performs its own research and is a strategic manager of the knowledge, information, data and competences necessary to deliver high quality and relevant evidence for smarter policies. To achieve this, the JRC works together with the best organisations world-wide, and with international, national and regional experts and stakeholders. Its research contributes to the general objectives and priorities of Horizon Europe, provides independent scientific knowledge, advice and technical support for Union policies throughout the policy cycle, and is focussed on European policy priorities, supporting a Europe that is safe and secure, prosperous and sustainable, social and stronger on the global scene.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e2381-15-1">7.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of intervention</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e2389-15-1">7.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening the Knowledge Base for Policy Making</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Knowledge and data are growing exponentially. If policy makers are to make sense and use of them they must be reviewed and filtered. There is also a need for cross-cutting scientific methods and analytical tools for use by all Commission services, in particular to anticipate upcoming societal challenges and support better regulation. This includes innovative processes to engage stakeholders and citizens in policy-making issues and various tools of impact and implementation assessment.</p>

            <p id="LI2021167EN.01001501-g-096-0096" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">INNOVATIVE EUROPE</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Innovation in all its forms is a key driver for the Union to continue delivering prosperity to its citizens and meeting challenges of the future. Innovation requires a systemic, cross-cutting and multifaceted approach. Europe's economic progress, social welfare and quality of life rely on its ability to boost productivity and growth, which, in turn, depends heavily on its ability to innovate. Innovation is also key to solving the major challenges that lie ahead for the Union. Innovation must be responsible, ethical and sustainable.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">As in the case of its predecessor, innovation is at the heart of Horizon Europe. The quest for acceleration of knowledge transfer and new ideas, products and processes is driving Horizon Europe objectives and implementing modalities, from strategic planning to calls, and is present from the onset to the end of any project supported, from 'blue-sky' research to industrial or technological roadmaps and missions.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">However, innovation deserves specific measures, as the Union must decisively enhance the conditions and environment for European innovation to thrive, so that ideas are quickly shared between actors in the innovation ecosystem, and new ideas and technologies swiftly transformed into the products and services needed for the Union to deliver.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Recent decades have seen the emergence of major and global new markets in health care, media, entertainment, communication and retail, based on breakthrough innovations in ICT, biotech, green-tech, internet and the platform economy. Further downstream in the innovation process, these market-creating innovations which impact the Union economy as a whole are deployed by fast-growing and often new companies. However, these companies seldom originate and scale-up in the Union.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">A new global wave of breakthrough innovation is coming, one that will be based on more 'deep-tech' technologies such as block-chain, AI, genomics/multiomics and robotics, as well as other technologies which may also emerge from individual innovators and communities of citizens. They have in common that they are taking shape at the intersection between different scientific disciplines, technological solutions and economic sectors, offering radically new combinations of products, processes, services and business models, and have the potential to open up new markets worldwide. Additional critical sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, transport or energy will also be impacted.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Europe must ride that wave. It is well positioned as the new wave comes in 'deep-tech' areas, in which Europe has already significantly invested, notably in the key enabling technologies. Europe therefore has some competitive advantages regarding science and knowledge, including in terms of human resources, and can build on close public-private cooperation (for example in health care or energy).</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">For Europe to lead that new wave of breakthrough innovation, the following underlying challenges need to be met:</p>

Private venture capital is key to turning breakthrough innovations into world-leading companies, but in Europe the amount raised is less than a quarter of that raised in the US and in Asia; Europe must bridge the 'valley of death', whereby ideas and innovations fail to reach the market due to the gap between public support and private investment, in particular with regard to high-risk breakthrough innovations that must be supported by long-term investments;</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">In order to cope with the new global wave of breakthrough innovation, Union support to innovators requires an agile, simple, seamless and tailored approach. Policy to develop and deploy breakthrough innovations and scale-up companies must be bold in taking risks and must take into account the above-mentioned challenges and add value to related innovation activities implemented by individual Member States or regions.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Horizon Europe's 'Innovative Europe' pillar, in cooperation with other Union policies and in particular the InvestEU Programme, is designed to deliver such tangible results. It builds on lessons learned and on experience gained under the previous framework programmes, in particular from activities such as FET, Fast Track to Innovation and the SME Instrument, but also private and corporate finance (such as FP7 RSFF, Horizon 2020 InnovFin), gathered and streamlined within the activities of the EIC pilot launched for the period 2018-2020.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Based on these experiences, this pillar provides for the launch of the EIC, which will promote mainly the breakthrough and disruptive technologies and innovation targeting especially market-creating innovation, while also supporting all types of innovations, including incremental, especially within SMEs including start-ups, and in exceptional cases small- mid-caps with rapid scale-up potential at Union and global level.

It must be a common European endeavour to support innovation all across Europe, and in all dimensions and forms, including through complementary Union, national and regional policies (including through effective synergies with ERDF and smart specialisation strategies) and resources whenever possible. Hence, this pillar provides also for renewed and reinforced coordination and cooperation mechanisms with Member States and associated countries, but also with private initiatives, in order to support all actors of the European innovation ecosystems, including at regional and local level.</p>

In order to bridge the 'valley of death' for any type of high-risk innovation, including in particular breakthrough and 'deep tech' innovations that are key to Europe's future growth, public support must develop a radically new approach. Where the market does not provide viable financial solutions, public support should provide for a specific risk-sharing mechanism, bearing more, if not all, of the initial risk of potential breakthrough market-creating innovations in order to attract alternate private investors in a second stage, as operations unfold and the risk is reduced until the company carrying out the innovative project becomes bankable.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Consequently the Accelerator will provide financial support to SMEs including start-ups and, in exceptional cases, small mid-caps that have the ambition to develop and deploy in Union and international markets their breakthrough innovations and to scale-up rapidly. For that purpose it will build on the experience from Phases 2 and&nbsp;3 of Horizon 2020 SME Instrument and from Horizon 2020 InnovFin, including through the addition of non-grant components and the ability to support larger and longer investments.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Blended financial support will be awarded through a single process and with a single decision, providing the supported innovator with a single global commitment to financial resources covering the various stages of innovation until market deployment, including pre-mass commercialisation. The full implementation of the awarded support will be subject to milestones and review. The combination and volume of financing will be adapted to the needs of the company, its size and stage, the nature of the technology or innovation and the length of the innovation cycle. The Accelerator will cover financing needs until replacement by alternative sources of investment.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Accelerator will also provide support in the form of grants to SMEs, including start-ups, to carry out a range of innovation types, from incremental to breakthrough and disruptive innovation, provided that those SMEs are aiming to subsequently scale-up.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The support will be provided through the same continuously open and bottom-up call as the one used for the blended-finance support. A start-up or an SME may benefit only once during Horizon Europe from grant-only support from the EIC, and that support will not exceed EUR 2,5 million. Proposals shall include detailed information on the capacities of the applicant to scale-up.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">For projects that have benefitted from a grant-only support, the Accelerator may subsequently, following a request by the beneficiaries, provide them with finance support (for example 'an equity support only'), through the EIC special purpose vehicle subject to the due diligence results of the latter.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">When a selected project is receiving a grant component of support for its R&amp;I activities, those activities may be implemented in collaboration with public or private research organisations, for example through subcontracting, to ensure that the beneficiary has optimal access to technical and business expertise. This will allow the beneficiary to develop with a strong foundation in the existing knowledge, expertise and ecosystems across Europe.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Where the various risks, such as financial, scientific/technological, market, management, and regulatory, are reduced, the relative importance of the reimbursable advance component is expected to increase.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">While the Union may bear alone the initial risk of selected innovation and market deployment actions, the aim will be to de-risk these and to stimulate, from the outset and during the development of the action, co-investments from alternative sources and even substitute investors. In that event, the objectives and schedule of the co-investment will be agreed with the co-investor(s) and the beneficiaries/supported companies.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Accelerator will operate mainly through a continuously open and bottom-up call, with cut-off dates, targeting SMEs including start-ups, and in exceptional cases small mid-caps, including young and female innovators managing or holding key skills in these companies. This open and bottom-up call may be complemented by targeted support for emerging breakthrough, market-creating and/or deep-tech innovations of potential strategic significance in terms of economic or social impact, while maintaining the predominantly bottom-up nature of the Accelerator. The topics for this targeted support will be described in the work programmes. Investors, including public innovation agencies, may also submit proposals, but the support shall be awarded directly to the company carrying out the innovative project they are interested in.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Accelerator will also allow for take-up of innovations stemming from Pathfinder-supported projects and from other pillars of the Union framework programmes&nbsp;<a id="ntc25-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0025" href="#ntr25-LI2021167EN.01001501-E0025">(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">25</span>)</a>, in order to support them in reaching the market. This identification of projects supported in other pillars of Horizon Europe and also previous framework programmes will be based on pertinent methodologies, such as the Innovation Radar.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In addition, for scale-up purpose and in compliance with point (a) of Article&nbsp;48(6) of Regulation (EU) 2021/695, subject to an initial mapping exercise, successful proposals from eligible national or regional programmes could also have access to the Accelerator evaluation phase under the following cumulative and sequential conditions:</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will take a pro-active approach to the management of high-risk projects, through access to the necessary expertise.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will appoint on a temporary basis a number of EIC programme managers to assist it with business- and technology-based vision and operational guidance. The Programme Committee will be informed of the appointments.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Programme managers will come from multiple spheres, including companies, universities, national laboratories and research centres. They will bring deep expertise from personal experience and years in the field. They will be recognised leaders, either having managed multidisciplinary research teams or directed large institutional programmes, and know the importance of communicating their visions tirelessly, creatively and broadly. Lastly, they will have experience in overseeing important budgets, which require a sense of responsibility.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Programme managers will be expected to boost the impact of EIC funding by fostering an 'active management' culture, combining a sound technological knowledge with a hands-on approach involving the development at portfolio and project levels of vision-based budgets, timelines and milestones that EIC projects must meet to receive continued funding.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In particular, programme managers oversee the implementation of Pathfinder and Accelerator calls, and provide opinion to the expert evaluation committees, based on clear and fair criteria and in view of a consistent strategic portfolio of projects, expected to make essential contributions to the emergence of potential societal or economic market-creating innovations.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Programme managers will have the task of nurturing Pathfinder portfolios by developing together with beneficiaries a common vision and a common strategic approach that lead to a critical mass of effort. This will involve the enhancement of new, recently-developed fields of research, and the building-up and structuring of new communities, with the objective of bringing cutting-edge breakthrough ideas into genuine and mature market-creating innovations. Programme managers will implement transition activities, further developing the portfolios with relevant additional activities and partners, and closely monitoring potential spin-offs and start-ups.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">To allow more flexibility, programme managers will review Pathfinder and Accelerator projects for each milestone or predefined criteria at relevant intervals according to the project development, to assess whether they should be continued, reoriented or terminated according to defined methods and procedures for project management. Where relevant, such assessments may involve independent external experts. In accordance with its Staff Regulations, the Commission will ensure that there is no conflict of interest, nor breach of confidentiality, of programme managers in the execution of all their tasks.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Given the high-risk nature of the actions, it is expected that a significant number of projects will not reach completion. Budget decommitted from such terminated projects will be used to support other EIC actions and shall be communicated in a timely manner to the Programme Committee.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e3050-15-1">1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the EIC blended finance</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will manage all operational elements of Accelerator projects, including the grant or other non-repayable forms of support.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">For the purpose of managing EIC blended finance, the Commission shall establish a special purpose vehicle. The Commission shall seek to ensure the participation of other public and private investors. Where this is not possible at the initial set-up, the EIC special purpose vehicle will be structured in such a way that it can attract other public or private investors in order to increase the leverage effect of the Union contribution.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will endorse the investment strategy of the EIC special purpose vehicle. The EIC special purpose vehicle will define and implement an exit strategy for its equity participations, which will include the possibility to propose the transfer of (a share of) an investment operation to the implementing partners supported under the InvestEU Programme, where appropriate and for operations whose risks have been sufficiently lowered so that they meet criteria of Article&nbsp;209(2) of the Financial Regulation. The Programme Committee will be informed accordingly by the Commission.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The EIC special purpose vehicle will perform due diligence and negotiate technical terms of each investment in compliance with the principles of additionality and prevention of conflicts of interest with other activities of the investees and of other counterparts. The EIC special purpose vehicle will proactively leverage public or private investments into individual Accelerator operations.</p>

            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e3074-15-1">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">To fully harness the potential of innovation involving researchers, entrepreneurs, industry and society at large, the Union, together with the Member States, must improve the environment within which innovation can flourish at all levels. This means contributing to the development of an effective innovation ecosystem at Union level, and encouraging cooperation, networking and the exchange of ideas and knowledge, developing open innovation processes in organisations, funding and skills among national, regional and local innovation ecosystems, in order to support all types of innovation, reach out to all innovators across the Union and provide them with adequate support.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union and Member States must also aim to develop ecosystems that support social innovation and public sector innovation, in addition to innovation in private enterprises. Indeed, the government sector must innovate and renew itself in order to be able to support the changes in regulation and governance required to support the large-scale deployment of innovations, including new technologies and a growing public demand for the more efficient and effective delivery of services. Social innovations are crucial to enhance the welfare of our societies.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">To attain these objectives, activities will be implemented to complement and to ensure synergies with the EIC's types of action, as well as with the activities of the EIT, with activities undertaken under other pillars of Horizon Europe and with activities implemented by Member States and associated countries, but also by private initiatives.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e3088-15-1">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of intervention</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">As a first step, the Commission will organise an EIC Forum of Member States and associated countries' public authorities and bodies in charge of innovation policies and programmes, with the aim of promoting coordination and dialogue on the development of the Union's innovation ecosystem. The EIC Board and the EIT Board will also be associated. Within the EIC Forum, the Commission will:</p>

It shall aim to strengthen collaborate links across Europe and open up European R&amp;I networks, contribute to improving research management capacities in the widening countries, support national policy reforms as well as exploit the potential of the Union's talent pool by targeted actions.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union has a history of world-class scientific and technological achievements, but its R&amp;I potential fails to be fully exploited. Despite much progress in developing the ERA, including the ERA roadmap and national ERA action plans, Europe still has a fragmented R&amp;I landscape, and all Member States face bottlenecks in their R&amp;I systems which require policy reforms. In some areas, progress is too slow to catch up with an increasingly dynamic R&amp;I ecosystem.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The level of R&amp;I investment in Europe is still far below the policy objective of 3&nbsp;% of GDP and continues to grow less than our main competitors such as US, Japan, China or South Korea.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Meanwhile, there is a growing disparity in Europe between those countries and regions that lead in R&amp;I and those that lag behind. Change, for example through more and better links between R&amp;I actors across Europe, is needed if Europe as a whole is to capitalise on excellence from across the continent, maximise the value of public and private investments, and their impact on productivity, economic growth, job creation and well-being. In addition, there is a need for structural R&amp;I policy reforms and better national, regional and institutional cooperation in the production and diffusion of high-quality knowledge.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In addition, R&amp;I is seen by some as distant and elitist without clear benefits for citizens, instilling attitudes that hamper the creation and uptake of innovative solutions, and scepticism about evidence-based public policies. This requires both better linkages between scientists, researchers, innovators, entrepreneurs, citizens and policy-makers, and more robust approaches to pooling scientific evidence itself in a changing society.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Union now needs to raise the bar on the quality and impact of its R&amp;I system, requiring a revitalised ERA across the Union and associated countries, better supported by the Union's R&amp;I framework programmes and national and regional programmes. Specifically, according to Article&nbsp;181(2) of the TFEU, a well-integrated yet tailored set of Union measures is needed, combined with reforms and performance enhancements at national level (to which the Smart Specialisation Strategies supported under the European Regional Development Fund as well as the Policy Support Facility can contribute) and, in turn, effective institutional changes within research funding and performing organisations, including universities, leading to outstanding knowledge production. By combining efforts at Union level, synergies can be exploited across Europe and the necessary scale can be found to make support to national policy reforms more efficient and impactful.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The activities supported under this part specifically address ERA policy priorities, while generally underpinning all parts of Horizon Europe. Activities may also be established to foster brain circulation across ERA through mobility of researchers and innovators, taking fully into account current imbalances, and to create and develop networks of scholars, scientists, researchers and innovators to put all their (intangible) assets to the service of the ERA and by supporting the development of domain-specific science roadmaps.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The goal is a Union where knowledge and a highly-skilled workforce circulate freely, research outputs are shared rapidly and efficiently, researchers benefit from attractive careers and gender equality is ensured, where Member States and associated countries develop common strategic research agendas, aligning national plans, defining and implementing joint programmes, and where the outcomes of R&amp;I are understood and trusted by informed citizens and benefit society as a whole.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">This part will contribute de facto to all SDGs, but directly to the following: SDG 4 – Quality Education; SDG 5 – Gender Equality; SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 17 – Partnership for the Goals.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e3160-15-1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WIDENING PARTICIPATION AND SPREADING EXCELLENCE</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Reducing disparities and the existing divide in R&amp;I performance by sharing knowledge and expertise across the Union will help widening countries and the Union outermost regions to attain a competitive position in the global value chains and the Union to fully benefit from the R&amp;I potential of all Member States.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Further action, for example through the promotion of openness and diversity of project consortia, is therefore needed to counter the trend for closed collaborations, which can exclude large number of promising institutions and individuals, including newcomers, and to exploit the potential of the Union's talent pool by maximising and sharing the benefits of R&amp;I across the Union.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Within the broad areas of activities, the funding lines will facilitate specific research elements customised to the particular needs of the actions.</p>
