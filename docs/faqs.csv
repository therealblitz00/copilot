,19700,What is the impact on Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe grants of the restrictive measures adopted by the EU against Russia over its military aggression against Ukraine?,"Since 2014 there have been several waves of restrictions against Russian participation in EU funding which have gradually extended both in target and scope, that have direct implications on the Horizon 2020 (H2020) and Horizon Europe (HE) Programmes.For example, following the adoption of the 14th package of restrictive measures towards Russia (as provided by Article 5l of Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine (OJ L 229, 31.7.2014, p. 1–11), as amended by Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (OJ L, 24.06.2024)), it is prohibited to provide direct or indirect support (as it is the case of EU-funded grants) to:Legal entities established in Russia; andLegal entities established outside Russia whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50 % by legal entities established in Russia.In summary, there are three categories of entities targeted by the EU restrictive measures (sanctions) relevant for H2020 and HE grants:Listed entities subject to an asset freeze: Persons or entities that are specifically listed by name in the restrictive measures adopted by the EU.Entities falling under Article 5l of the 14th package of restrictive measures: any legal entity established in Russia and any legal entity established outside Russia whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50 % by entities established in Russia.Other listed or non-listed entities: Other entities that fall under one of the sector-specific restrictive measures (e.g. aviation and space industry, dual use technology).In practical terms, the impact of the restrictive measures on H2020 and HE grants is as follows:Grants to be signedEntities falling under any (or several) of the EU restrictive measures or Horizon-specific WP eligibility restrictions are ineligible in Horizon actions and thus cannot participate in grants to be signed under the EU Research and Innovation Programmes. This ban applies not only to their potential participation as beneficiaries, but to their potential participation in any kind of role: beneficiaries, linked third parties/affiliated entities, subcontractors, in-kind contributors, international partners/associated partners, and third parties receiving financial support.What shall I do if in my proposal under evaluation there is a participant subject to the EU restrictive measures?Please note that, during evaluation, experts will focus on the technical evaluation of the project activities as presented in the proposal. However, if your proposal is retained you will be likely requested to remove the concerned participant during the grant agreement preparation phase (GAP).What shall I do if in my proposal under GAP there is a participant covered by the sanctions?During GAP, sanctioned entities should be removed from the proposal. The coordinator will be informed of the need to amend the proposal by either distributing the work of the concerned entity among the other members of the consortium or by introducing a new participant, within the terms of the concerned call.On-going grants (already signed)In on-going grants, the participation of entities subject to the EU restrictive measures must be terminated:If the entity participates as beneficiary, the EU granting authority will initiate the termination of its participation in the grant in line with the corresponding articles of the grant agreement. After the termination of the beneficiary takes effect, following the sending of the confirmation letter, the coordinator will be contacted to redistribute the tasks of the terminated beneficiary and to submit an amendment request.For the removal of other types of participants (linked third parties/affiliated entities and international partners/associated partners), the EU granting authority will request the consortium, via the coordinator, to launch an amendment to remove it from the grant agreement. If the consortium refuses to do so, the grant agreement may be terminated by the EU granting authority.In addition, as the restrictive measures adopted by the EU are directly applicable to all entities receiving EU funds:Each beneficiary must stop using in the EU grant in-kind contributions from entities affected by the restrictive measures.Each beneficiary must take care of the removal of its subcontractors affected by the restrictive measures. No new subcontracts should be signed with entities affected by the restrictive measures.Outstanding paymentsOutstanding payments for entities concerned by the sanctions cannot be carried out and will be withheld by the EU granting authorities until the sanctions are lifted. The coordinator of each particular grant concerned will be informed of the amount withheld, that basically corresponds to the amount to which the beneficiary under sanction is entitled to, based on its accepted eligible costs.Special case: Fellowships and similar allowances granted to natural persons of Russian nationalityFellowships and similar allowances granted to natural persons of Russian nationality may continue if the following cumulative conditions are fulfilled:the fellowship/allowance is either paid directly to the person or via a beneficiary not subject to the restrictive measures explained above;the fellow is not targeted by restrictive measures (i.e. neither listed (subject to an asset freeze), nor falling under the sector-specific restrictive measures); andthe project activity is not contrary to the restrictive measures.Fellowships and similar allowances granted to natural persons of any other nationality can carry out research even if the fellow’s activity takes place in the Russian Federation or Russian-controlled territories, provided that the activity is not carried out in the premises of entities subject to the restrictive measures.The above applies to activities already stated in the description of the action; for new activities it is discouraged to engage in Russia or with Russian beneficiaries.",20/06/2025,FALSE
,59880,"In the frame of Innovative Training Networks (MSCA-ITN) and Doctoral Networks (MSCA-DN) Actions, can “Contracts for Specific Work” issued by Greek beneficiaries (“Συμβάσεις Έργου”) be considered compliant with the MSCA requirements? ","MSCA researchers need to be employed under an employment contract or equivalent direct contract, which confers similar benefits and social security coverage.This includes:-     sickness, parental, unemployment, and invalidity benefits,-     pension rights, and-     benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases.If national law prohibits this possibility, beneficiaries may exceptionally and subject to the granting authority’s prior agreement offer a fixed-amount fellowship with minimum social security coverage, but the living allowance will be reduced by 50%.""Contracts for Specific Work""/ “Συμβάσεις Έργου” issued by Greek beneficiaries in the frame of an Innovative Training Networks (MSCA-ITN) and Doctoral Networks Action (MSCA-DN) cannot be considered by default compliant with the MSCA requirements. The option of a fixed-term employment contract remains the preferred one. Contracts for Specific Work can only be accepted under the condition that they are accompanied by an Addendum (Annex) which includes the missing information and MSCA requirements laid down in the Specific Rules for carrying out the MSCA Action (Article 18) laid down in Annex 5 to the HE Unit MGA and Article 32.1 of the H2020 MSCA-ITN MGA.The purpose of the Addendum is to complement the main text of the contract and should not contradict the provisions of the main text.The Addendum should address the following points: 1. Clauses incompatible with the MSCA rules should not appear in the contract. These include provisions about the absence/non establishment of an employment/subordinated relationship, the simple possibility for the MSCA researcher to work from the contractor's premises (without this being stipulated as an obligation though), and the absence of a procedure or prior notice for the termination of the contractual relationship.2. Examples of Elements/Clauses which are usually missing and need to be specified in the Addendum: the name of the supervisor(s), the starting date and duration of the research training activities, the monthly support of the researcher under the Grant Agreement, the obligation of the researcher to work exclusively for the action and to not to receive for activities carried out in the frame of the action, other income than those received from the beneficiary, the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights, the duty of confidentiality and other rights and obligations of both the researcher and the beneficiary.Greek beneficiaries are expected to amend the running Contracts for Specific Work in line with these requirements and to implement the above conditions when signing new Contracts for Specific Work in order to establish them in the correct format and content since the very beginning.The Greek NCPs remain the first contact point for any questions.",16/06/2025,FALSE
,16071,What is considered a Communication or Dissemination activity within a scientific funded project?,Talking to the scientific community is dissemination as you are sharing your results to a scientific audience likely to use them.

,19531,Regarding open science requirements in Horizon Europe: a) where are they described? b) what are the consequences of non-compliance?,"a) The legal basis for the open science requirements in Horizon Europe is established in Articles 2.5, 14, and 39 of Regulation (EU) 2021/695 (Horizon Europe Regulation).The specific mandatory open science provisions are outlined in Article 17 of the Model Grant Agreement.For more detailed guidance, the Annotated Model Grant Agreement (AGA) provides additional information on the implementation and expectations for open science in funded projects. b) Violations of the open science provisions are treated the same as other violations of the Model Grant Agreement.Sanctions for non-compliance could include penalties outlined in Article 17.5 and Chapter 5 of the Model Grant Agreement.These sanctions may include the possibility of a grant reduction, as detailed in Article 28 of the Agreement",28/05/2025,FALSE
,348,"As an organisation, is it possible to suggest experts to be included in the database?","Yes, your organisation can suggest experts for inclusion in the database by asking them to register themselves through the Funding & Tenders Portal. This will expand the pool of experts the European Commission can access when needed.",28/05/2025,FALSE
,16469,"Under Horizon Europe, why is there an obligation for the beneficiary to use the Horizon Results Platform one year after the end of the grant?","Under Horizon Europe, the obligation applies for beneficiaries who have not succeeded in exploiting their research results after one year. The European Commission is aware that some exploitation measures may require time in order to become fully tangible/implemented. Using the Horizon Results Platform does not prevent beneficiaries from continuing their activities in results exploitation. The obligation to exploit the results, directly or indirectly, applies to beneficiaries up to 4 years after the end of the project.",28/05/2025,FALSE
,19534,"a, What is required for open access publications and how can authors comply? b, What is the prior obligation and how should authors enter into publishing agreements? c, Which publishing fees are eligible?","a) The beneficiaries must ensure open access to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results in a trusted repository immediate at publication with a CC BY or equivalent license. This includes articles and long-text formats such as monographs and other types of books. For long-text formats, the license may exclude commercial and/or derivative use). Beneficiaries can publish in any venue of their choice (whether full open access, subscription, hybrid, etc.) but have to comply with the requirements for open access to their peer-reviewed publications, that is to ensure immediate open access via trusted repositories under open licenses.Authors must:ensure deposition of their peer-reviewed scientific publications in a trusted repository;provide immediate open access through the repository (either to the Author Accepted Manuscript or the Version of Record);provide open access under a Creative Commons Attribution International Public License -CC BY- or equivalent for articles. For long-text formats, the license applied may exclude commercial and/or derivative use (CC BY-NC / CC BY-ND / CC BY-NC-ND licenses, or equivalent).b) The obligation of the beneficiary and author to provide open access per the Grant Agreement, precedes any publisher agreement concerning work deriving from the Horizon-funded projects and is therefore a prior obligation.Beneficiaries should inform their authors on existing prior obligation. They and authors should refrain from signing publishing agreements that are contrary to their open access prior obligation as this would be an express breach of their grant agreements and may cast doubt on the good faith of the Horizon Europe beneficiary. When signing a contract with a publisher, it is recommended that authors do not give them exclusive rights of their work but rather a non-exclusive license, as this empowers them to remain in control of their rights and meet Horizon Europe’s open access obligations.Authors should identify publication venues that allow them to meet the Horizon Europe open access requirements. The use of the Journal Checker Tool (https://journalcheckertool.org/) can facilitate this task. Publication in Open Research Europe (https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/) allows compliance with the Horizon Europe requirements.c) Publishing fees are eligible when publishing in full open access publishing venues (journals/books/platforms in which the entire scholarly content is openly accessible to all).Publishing fees for open access books may be eligible to the extent that they cover the first digital open access edition of the book, which could include different formats, such as PDF, ePub, HTML.The following costs are not eligible:costs of publications in hybrid venues, e.g. hybrid journals or books that are not entirely open access (whether committed to transition to a fully open access journal or covered by agreements between institutions and publishers). In case a decision is made to publish in hybrid venues, alternative funds must be found to pay the publishing fees, including open access Article Processing Charges;any printing fees (for monographs / other books­ or articles).Beneficiaries have the possibility to publish at no cost in Open Research Europe, the European Commission open access publishing platform.",28/05/2025,FALSE

,16079,"When drafting a proposal under Horizon Europe: how detailed should the level of Dissemination, Exploitation and Communication activities be, along with the results in the proposal and the allocated funding?","1. Budget proportionality: The proposed budget should be proportional to the planned Dissemination & Exploitation (D&amp;E) activities. The main D&amp;E activities must be listed in detail and aligned with the corresponding budget allocation.2. Summary of activities: Proposals must include a summary of the communication, dissemination, and exploitation measures that the project intends to carry out to achieve the desired impact.3.

,19521,How is open science evaluated at proposal stage in Horizon Europe?,"In Horizon Europe, open science practices are considered in the evaluation of proposals, under the “excellence” and under the “quality and efficiency of implementation” award criteria.There are open science practices that are mandatory for all projects through the Model Grant Agreement (article 17) and/or through specific work programme or call conditions, and there are open science practices that are recommended.Recommended open science practices are incentivised through their evaluation at proposal stage.Proposers should be aware of both mandatory and recommended practices and integrate them into their proposals. A definition for open science practices is provided in the annotated grant agreement and the programme guide.The latter explains the difference between mandatory and recommended practices. Failure to sufficiently address mandatory practices in proposals will result in a lower evaluation score. Certain work programme topics or call conditions may encourage specific additional open science practices. A clear explanation of how proposers will adopt recommended practices, as appropriate for their project, will result in a higher evaluation score. If proposers believe that none of the open science practices (mandatory or recommended) apply to their project, they will have to provide a justification.",28/05/2025,FALSE
,19544,"On Research Data Management: a,How long should data be available after projects finish? b,Are there Data Management Plan (DMP) templates available? c,Are there exceptions for open access to data? d,Can additional budget for data management be requested?","a, It is recommended to keep the data available for at least 5 years, preferably 10 years, or longer based on disciplinary practices for re-use/validation purposes.

If the action is not properly implemented (i.e. when it is not carried out as described in the grant agreement and in line with the obligations therein), the grant can be reduced, and the reduction can affect all beneficiaries. In lump sum grants, proper implementation requires that the activities in each work package are completed. If a work package is not completed by the end of the action duration, the lump sum share for this work package will normally be reduced in proportion to the missing work. Briefly,In case a work package is fully rejected, the beneficiaries participating in this work package are liable for up to the amount of their lump sum share in this work package.In case of partial rejection of the work package (partial payment), the liability is reduced proportionally. If it is only a specific beneficiary who did not perform its activities, only the lump sum share(s) of that beneficiary will be rejected without reducing the lump sum shares of other beneficiaries that completed their activities.The implementation of lump sum projects is judged by the same standards as all other Horizon grants, and there is no reason to expect more grant reductions in lump sum grants. Still, the consortium agreement should contain provisions to cover this possibility (e.g. internal organisation of the consortium, distribution of payments, rights and obligations, handling underperformance or lack of cooperation). For more details on how reductions are handled in lump sum grants, refer to section 5.3 ‘Payments’ of the guidance document ‘How to manage your lump sum grants’.",10/02/2025,FALSE
,21477,What is the budget flexibility in lump sum projects?,"As long as your lump sum project is implemented as described in the grant agreement, the lump sum will be paid in full and can be spent in any way you like. How it is actually spent is subject to internal agreements of the consortium, and we will only monitor that the project is executed as agreed. This is a different and more far-reaching flexibility than the budget flexibility in actual cost grants. Budget flexibility within the meaning of actual cost grants does not apply because there are no actual costs in lump sum grants. Transfers between budget categories – as in actual cost grants – do therefore not exist in lump sum projects.Lump sum shares can be transferred between beneficiaries (i.e. increasing the share of a beneficiary and decreasing the share of another) and/or between work packages (i.e. increasing the share allocated to a work package and decreasing the share of another). Such transfers need to be justified by the technical implementation of the project. If the consortium wants to reflect these changes in the grant agreement, an amendment is required which leads to an updated Annex 2. This can be useful, for example, to ensure that the financial liability follows the actual distribution of the lump sum shares among the partners.",10/02/2025,FALSE
,11526,How are periodic reports prepared for lump sum grants in Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020?,"At the end of each reporting period, you need to submit the technical and financial report in the Periodic Reporting module of the online Grant Management System. The approach is the same as for standard grants except that in lump sum grants:the coordinator must complete the ‘status of work packages’ table in the Grant Management System and mark work packages as ‘completed’ or ‘not completed’.the technical report must focus on the completion of work packages (in particular, when you declare a work package as completed, the report must explain and justify this); the ‘use of resources report’ is not applicable for lump sum grants.the financial report is much simplified and to a large extent automated (based on the declaration of completed work packages).",10/02/2025,FALSE
,21474,How are the reporting periods set for lump sum grants under Horizon Europe?,"Reporting periods are defined during grant preparation and fixed in the Grant Agreement in all Horizon Europe grants. Lump sum grants follow the same rules as all other grants in this respect. The standard reporting period in Horizon Europe is 18 months. The number of reporting periods depends on the action duration. Normally, the smallest possible number of reporting periods is used (e.g., 2 reporting periods for an action duration of 19 to 36 months, 3 reporting periods for an action duration of 37 to 54 month, etc.)",10/02/2025,FALSE
,11521,How will the pre-financing be fixed for lump sum grants in Horizon Europe?,"The pre-financing for lump sum grants is calculated in the same way as for all Horizon Europe grants. It is a percentage of the lump sum that depends on the number of reporting periods. For projects with one reporting period, the pre-financing is normally 80% of the lump sum. For projects with two or more reporting periods, the pre-financing is normally 160% of the average EU funding per reporting period (i.e. lump sum/number of periods). As in other grants, a small percentage of the lump sum is retained as contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism. The pre-financing is fixed in the grant agreement. The coordinator should distribute it in accordance with the consortium agreement.",10/02/2025,FALSE
,54970,For ERC projects under Horizon Europe (HE) when are the reports due?,"For ERC projects under Horizon Europe (HE), one of the specificities of the ERC Grant Agreement is the separation of the scientific and financial reporting streams into two distinct sets of reporting requirements:Scientific progress report. The progress report covers the reporting period from month 1 to month 24. For Synergy grants there are two scientific interim reports (month 24 and month 48).Financial interim report. The interim report typically covers the reporting period from month 1 to month 30. For Synergy grants there are three interim reports (month 18, 36 and 54).The final periodic report combines the final scientific report with the final financial report (single submission), and covers the last reporting period of the project. At the end of each reporting period, the beneficiary will receive a notification via the Funding & Tenders portal to complete the periodic report.The submission of the above reports is due within 60 days from the end of the respective reporting period. ",03/02/2025,FALSE
,11525,Is it allowed to declare partially completed work packages under the lump sum funding scheme in Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020?,"You may exceptionally declare a work package as partially completed at the end of the last reporting period. In this case, you need to indicate a percentage of completion that should correspond to the share of activities described in the grant agreement that have been carried out.You should declare work packages as partially completed if essential parts have not been carried out and not been replaced with equivalent work. This needs to be explained and justified in the final technical report. The degree of completion is not linked to cost expenditure or use of resources.",10/01/2025,FALSE

,30162,How to handle own resources in lump sum proposals?,"In all Horizon Europe proposals, the budget must be in balance (total expenditure must equal total income). Specifically, the total project eligible costs on the one hand must equal the requested grant amount plus any own resources on the other hand. For better readability, we refer only to ‘own resources’ in this FAQ, but the information provided here applies equally to ‘financial contributions’ and ‘income generated by the action’. For further background see this FAQ.In lump sum proposals, you enter the project’s direct eligible costs in the detailed budget table (Excel tool). The Excel tool takes into account indirect costs and funding rates and calculates the lump sum shares (maximum amounts) that can be requested in Part A of the proposal. However, own resources are not part of the detailed budget, nor of the budget in Part A. They must be considered separately to ensure the budget is in balance.If you contribute own resources to the lump sum project,these own resources must be described in the ‘Any comments’ tab of the detailed budget table (provide the type of resource and the amount in EUR).the maximum amount you can request in the Part A budget table may be lower than the lump sum share calculated by the Excel tool (see below for details).Applicants with a funding rate of 100%: The requested grant amount in the Part A budget must equal the lump sum share calculated by the Excel tool minus the sum of your own resources. In the absence of own resources, the amount to be entered in the Part A budget is the lump sum share calculated by the Excel tool.Applicants with a funding rate of less than 100% (e.g. 70%):The minimum amount to contribute as own resources is the share of the total eligible costs that is not funded by the grant (i.e., the amount needed to have a balanced budget). If you contribute only this minimum amount, the amount to be entered in the Part A budget is the lump sum share calculated by the Excel tool.Any additional own resources, beyond the minimum defined above, must be subtracted from the lump sum share calculated by the Excel tool. The result is the amount to be entered in the Part A budget.Associated partnersYour own resources may be described in the ‘Any comments’ tab of the detailed budget table. No EU funding can be requested in the Part A budget table.If selected for funding, the Excel tool provides the lump sum shares for Annex 2 of the grant agreement. However, if a lower amount than calculated by the Excel tool was requested in Part A (e.g., to reflect own resources), the lump sum shares of the beneficiary concerned must be decreased accordingly.",17/05/2023,FALSE
,18452,What are Associated Partners and how should they be treated in the proposal and reporting?,"Associated partners are entities which participate in the action without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim contributions. They need to be registered in the Participant Register since the participant identification code (PIC) is mandatory for the submission of the application form, but they do not need to be validated.Associated partners do not have edit rights in the submission forms; the coordinator must encode all their information for them, including the information on role of participating organisation, researchers table and the information on participants’ previous activities related to the call. They also must include their budget under the columns ‘Income generated by the action’, ‘Own resources’ or ‘Financial contributions’ in the proposal budget table, as applicable. In addition, the tasks to be performed by associated partners must be described in the proposal part B, including their planned effort per WP.If the proposal is funded, associated partners do not sign the grant agreement and their budget is therefore not included in the annex 2 of the grant agreement. We keep for reference the budget included in the proposal. Periodic reports and deliverables must include information on the activities carried out by associated partners, however they do not have edit rights to use the grant management tool. Their contributions do not appear in the 'use of resources' section as part of the periodic reporting.Associated partners can become work package leaders, milestone leaders and lead beneficiaries in work packages in Horizon Europe projects.

Therefore, New Zealand entities will be eligible for funding with the same rights and under the same conditions as those other eligible entities. New Zealand beneficiaries will be able to lead project consortia and thus be coordinators. They will also count as entities established in an Associated Country towards the minimum number of countries requirement in calls for transnational projects.

,22307,Does the transitional arrangements apply to legal entities established in New Zealand?,"Yes. New Zealand is in the list of countries to which the transitional arrangements, if provided for in the particular Horizon Europe Work Programme, apply on the basis that the association negotiations are being processed or where association is imminent (see ‘List of Participating Countries’).
Therefore, New Zealand applicants are already treated as if New Zealand was an associated country throughout the process, from admissibility and eligibility to evaluation, up until the preparation of grant agreements. However, grant agreements with beneficiaries established in New Zealand on the basis of the association agreement can only be signed if the association has started producing legal effects, i.e. the agreement started to apply.
In that context, New Zealand legal entities including universities, research centres, scientists, innovative businesses, industry, etc. can submit proposals in which they participate as beneficiaries in the calls for collaborative proposals pertaining to Pillar II (“Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness”) published in Work Programmes 2023 onwards.

,22306,What parts of Horizon Europe will New Zealand be associated to?,"New Zealand is in the process of associating to Pillar II of Horizon Europe (‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’). As such, legal entities established in New Zealand will be eligible to apply and receive funding as beneficiaries, unless provided otherwise in the Horizon Europe Work Programmes.
This pillar is characterised by the multi- or interdisciplinary nature of its projects. Its collaborative research orientation and the priorities outlined in its clusters have strong synergies with the New Zealand R&amp;I system, and corresponds to both sides’ strong political will to address together global issues such as climate change, health, energy and mobility, food, bioeconomy and natural resources and environment.
In duly justified exceptional cases for actions related to the European Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security, Horizon Europe work programmes may provide that the participation can be limited to those legal entities established in eligible countries, e.g. EU Member States only, or in Member States and Associated Countries, or, to those legal entities established in specified Associated or other third countries in addition to Member States.
Moreover, for duly justified and exceptional reasons, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, the work programme may also exclude the participation of legal entities established in eligible countries but directly or indirectly controlled by ineligible countries or by legal entities established in ineligible countries from individual calls, or make their participation subject to conditions set out in the work programme.
Note that New Zealand legal entities can continue to apply and participate in the other parts of Horizon Europe, i.e. beyond Pillar II, unless exceptions apply without receiving EU funding, i.e. as associated partner, if allowed by the call conditions.

Try to negotiate with the publisher and if this is not possible, refrain from signing a publishing agreement that is contrary to their open access prior obligation as this would be an express breach of the open access prior obligation.
Look for an alternative publishing venue that allows them to meet their open access prior obligation.

Horizon Europe beneficiaries or authors should in any event refrain from signing a publishing agreement that will prevent immediate open access under CC BY (or an equivalent license) since failure to meet the open access prior obligation will result in a breach of their grant agreement.

The basic rules are the same as for actual cost grants. Briefly, 

Affiliated entities are legally linked to one of the main beneficiaries. For lump sum grants, they must provide cost estimations in the detailed budget table at proposal stage, and their lump sum shares are shown in the grant agreement (lump sum breakdown, Annex 2).
Associated partners are entities that implement parts of the action but without receiving EU funding. They do not complete the detailed budget table at proposal stage. In the lump sum grant agreement, they have no lump sum share associated to them.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. Costs for in-kind contributions are included in the lump sum share of the beneficiary receiving the in-kind contributions.

,11534,"Which documents must be kept and presented in case of checks, reviews, audits or investigations of Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020 lump sum grants?","Beneficiaries must keep adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the proper implementation of the action for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years for grants up to EUR 60 000). Those records must be available, verifiable, and auditable. For lump projects, beneficiaries do not need to keep records of their actual costs (e.g. timesheets or invoices). There is no financial reporting, and no checks or audits of the costs incurred. It goes without saying that participants still have to comply with financial record keeping obligations outside the grant agreement (e.g. under national law or under internal procedures). In case of checks, reviews, audits or investigations, the beneficiaries of lump sum grants must present adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the proper scientific and technical implementation of the action, as detailed in Annex 1 (e.g. for research activities, documentation required by good research practices such as lab books, technical documents, prototypes, publications, proceedings in conferences, etc.) The scientific and technical documentation required for lump sum grants is the same as for all grants (i.e. there are no additional technical documents to be kept specifically for lump sum grants).

However, the Hungarian entity will not be eligible to receive the prize and have to be rejected unless measures are lifted by the time of the award.
In compliance with the Rules of Contest for prizes, all applicants are jointly responsible and must all fulfil and respect the conditions set out therein including eligibility for participation. Therefore, in case of a joint application the applicants will be informed that the concerned Hungarian entity cannot receive the prize and be requested to confirm that they accept the prize award only for eligible applicants.
In case a Hungarian entity concerned by the Council implementing decision 2022/2506 intends to act as a lead applicant, other applicants will be requested to replace it and choose another lead applicant. If the applicants do not confirm their agreement to be awarded the prize without the concerned Hungarian entity or fail to replace it as coordinator, the application will be declared ineligible.

In-kind contributions are resources that a third party of a grant agreement put at the disposal to a beneficiary, for free, in order for the latter to implement its action tasks. In that respect, where the EU/Euratom funding programme allows to do so (as it is the case under Horizon Europe), a beneficiary can charge in-kind contribution costs, regardless whether these in-kind contributions are coming from a Hungarian entity concerned by the measures of the Council implementing decision. The applicable general and specific costs eligibility conditions set out in the grant agreement must in any case be fulfilled by the beneficiary declaring its in-kind contributions costs, as for any other of its costs.

Therefore, it would be possible to include as beneficiary a Hungarian entity formerly concerned by the measures set out in the Council Implementing Decision 2022/2506, if those measures are lifted later.

When applicants have to fill in in the budget table for the lump sum funding, they must present a detailed estimation of their costs, showing the costs and categories of costs covered by the lump sum contribution. On this basis, the breakdown of lump sum shares is generated automatically. The experts ensure that cost estimations are reasonable and non-excessive, and whether the resources proposed, and the budget-split of lump sum shares will allow for the completing the activities as described in the proposal. This is evaluated under the 'quality and efficiency of the implementation' evaluation criterion.

If a technical audit rejects a work package after the end of the project, fully or partially, the lump sum share corresponding to that work package is recovered from the beneficiaries involved in it. The recovery is calculated in accordance with the breakdown of the lump sum (Annex 2 to the grant agreement) and in proportion to the degree of rejection. If only the work of one of the beneficiaries is rejected, the recovery is only for that beneficiary and up to this beneficiary's lump sum share for that work package. If the rejection affects all beneficiaries involved in a work package, the amount rejected is recovered from all beneficiaries concerned in proportion to their share in that work package according to the lump sum breakdown (Annex 2).

,11532,Are there financial checks or audits for Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020 lump sum grants?,"There are no financial checks, reviews, or audits to check costs because there is no obligation to document the costs incurred for the action. Obligations to keep financial records outside the grant agreement still apply (e.g. under internal procedures or under national law).
Checks, reviews, and audits can focus on the proper implementation of the action and on any non-financial obligation, such as the promotion of the action, the visibility of EU funding, ethics and research integrity, dissemination and exploitation of results, management of intellectual property, obligations related to open science, etc.

Interim payments pay the lump sum shares for work packages completed during the corresponding reporting periods. The payment of the balance pays the remaining lump sum shares for the implementation of the action.
Payment does not depend on a successful outcome, but on the completion of activities.
If it is not possible to complete a work package by the end of the project for technical reasons or due to force majeure, the lump sum is paid partially in line with the degree of completion.

,11509,Does the lump sum funding scheme in Horizon Europe create an additional administrative burden for the consortium at proposal stage?,"The final objective of all simplification measures, including lump sums, is to make Horizon Europe as efficient as possible. Lump sum funding removes the obligations on actual cost reporting and financial ex-post audits, checks or reviews. At proposal stage a more detailed budget is requested from the consortium. However, during the project life, all obligations on actual cost reporting and financial ex-post audits are removed, thus contributing to the reduction of the administrative burden. Moreover, the budget details requested in the proposal do not go beyond what is needed in any case to set up a project budget. The additional effort to include this information in a lump sum proposal should therefore be limited.

The evaluation criteria, pre-financing and payment scheme are the same as for actual costs grants. Likewise, reporting periods and technical reporting are the same, though focusing on completion of work packages.
One lump sum share is fixed in the grant agreement for each work package and each beneficiary (and affiliated entity if any). This amount is paid when all the activities in the work package are completed. Payment does not depend on the successful outcome, but on the completion of activities. The description of activities to be implemented under each work package must be precise enough to enable to assess if a work package is completed or not.

In Type 1, the lump sum is prefixed by the Commission in the call for proposals and your budget must equal (add up to) the prefixed total. Proposals need to describe the efforts and resources applicants commit to mobilise for this amount. The applicants must provide a proposed split of lump sum per work package and per beneficiary and affiliated entity.
In Type 2, the amount of the lump sum is proposed by the applicants in their proposal, based on their estimated direct and indirect project costs.

The type of lump sum for a given topic is specified in the work programme. In practice, most lump sums under Horizon Europe use Type 2. After the evaluation, a lump sum share is fixed in the grant agreement for each work package and each beneficiary (or affiliated entity). This amount is paid when the activities in the work package are completed.

,11503,How to ensure that the awarded lump sum funding does not create profit for beneficiaries?,"In the case of lump sum funding, the methodology for establishing the lump sum serves in the first instance as a safeguard for compliance with the non-profit principle. The lump sum is either pre-fixed by the European Commission based on a dedicated methodology (Type 1) or is set out based on a detailed estimation of costs provided by the applicants in their proposal (Type 2). In both options, applicants must describe the resources linked to the activities in the work packages and the related estimated budgets per beneficiary and per work package. These are assessed by experts as part of the proposal evaluation. Once established in the grant agreement, the lump sums are paid against the delivery of activities linked to them.
",14/09/2022,FALSE
,11502,Why using simplified forms of funding?,"Simplified forms of funding like lump sums, unit costs and flat rates encourage a shift of attention from costs to outputs. Their main advantage is that they lead to a major reduction of administrative burden.
Lump sum funding in particular provides considerable simplification potential compared to standard funding as it removes all obligations on cost reporting, the need for timesheets and for financial ex-post audits, checks or reviews on costs incurred.
In this way, there is less focus on financial management, and more focus on the scientific-technical content of projects.

The decision on whether to publish through open access must come after the more general decision on whether to publish directly or first to file a patent application.
Regarding research data, open access is required by default, but always under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. This means that, as an exception, beneficiaries may decide to close (all or some of) their data, maybe temporarily, taking into consideration their legitimate interests, including commercial exploitation or any other constraints such as data protection rules, privacy, confidentiality or trade secrets. Beneficiaries must justify in the Data Management Plan (DMP) the exception(s) under which they choose to restrict access to some or all of the research data.

On the one hand, the FTRI is a procedure that may be applied to allow a faster, bottom-up access to funds for small collaborative consortia covering actions from fundamental research to market application. To this end, the FTRI may be proposed under some of the calls for proposals dedicated to select research and / or innovation actions under the Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness and the European Innovation Council Pathfinder parts of the Framework Programme.
On the other hand, the Fast Track scheme stems from Article 43(5) of Horizon Europe Regulation. Its purpose is to allow eligible funding bodies to directly submit for evaluation under the last award criterion (Article 43(4)(c)) a proposal for an innovation and market deployment action which already fulfils the first two criteria, provided that cumulative conditions as set out in the Regulation, in the Specific Programme, and in the Work Programme are met.

,18475,Can entities established in countries that are neither EU Member States nor associated to Horizon Europe participate in coordination and support actions?,"To be eligible to participate as beneficiaries (or affiliated entities) in Horizon Europe coordination and support actions (CSAs), legal entities must be established in a Member State or associated country, unless exceptionally the relevant work programme specifies (e.g. call conditions) that entities established in some or all non-associated third countries may also participate.
To become a beneficiary, legal entities must also be eligible for funding and they have to sign the grant agreement. Legal entities established in low to middle income non-associated third countries are automatically eligible for funding if identified in the Commission work programme (see the list of low to middle income non-associated third countries in the Horizon Europe programme guide). Legal entities established (or deemed to be established) in other third countries are exceptionally eligible for funding when either the Commission work programme (e.g. call conditions) provides for it or the Commission or the relevant funding body considers that the participation of the legal entity concerned is essential for implementing the action. If the entity is considered essential, it must participate as a beneficiary.
Legal entities not fulfilling both of the above conditions (regarding eligibility to participate AND to receive funding), i.e. legal entities established in non-associated third countries for which the work programme does not specify that they may participate or legal entities eligible to participate but not eligible for funding, may participate as associated partners (unless the work programme or the grant agreement lays down additional conditions which must be met to be able to participate in the action).

The budget table must be in balance (i.e. having expenditure equalling income).
Under ‘Revenues’, participants must include any expected income generated by the project (e.g. the sale of assets bought for the action and sold during the action duration).
Under ‘Other source of financing’ participants must include information over ‘own resources’ and ‘financial contributions’.

Under ‘own resources’, applicants must enter the amount of their own resources they expect to use for the implementation of the action. ‘Own resources’ refer to the own resources at the disposal of a beneficiary that are not linked specifically to the action submitted for funding under Horizon Europe. Typical examples could be financial resources that a beneficiary draws directly from its commercial activity; or resources coming from the beneficiary’s annual operating allocation (like a public university receiving a general annual subsidy from its national Ministry).
Under ‘financial contributions’, applicants must enter the amount of financial contributions they expect to receive/they already received from other sources. ‘Financial contributions’ refer to funding given by third parties to a beneficiary for being used specifically for the same action as the one submitted for funding under Horizon Europe (e.g. a specific nationally-funded grant/donation to a beneficiary that covers the same action).

Where applicable, these columns must be filled in by the applicants for all Horizon Europe types of actions (i.e. regardless whether the funding rate is 100% or lower). In that respect, applicants must genuinely report any expected income (i.e. income generated by the action, own resources or financial contributions) in the budget table in the Part A of the application form.
If there is any expected income for the action and the funding rate is 100%, applicants have to request a lower EU contribution to balance the budget. In the same way, when the funding rate is lower than 100%, applicants are asked from which type of sources the rest of the funding will come: income generated by the action, own resources or financial contributions. At a later stage, if the proposal is retained for funding, these budget categories will not be included in the budget table in the Grant Agreement.

,16047,"In Horizon Europe, what is the status of participants from non-EU, Associated or Third Countries?","Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-associated third countries or international organisations, is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not), provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met, along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call topic which may provide for limitations or restrictions in certain cases.
As per the ‘List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe’, the ‘Horizon Europe Programme Guide’ and the ‘Horizon Europe Work Programme 2021-2022 General Annexes’:

Legal entities from Associated Countries can participate under equivalent conditions as legal entities from the EU Member States, unless specific limitations or conditions are laid down in the work programme and/or call/topic text.
Most Horizon Europe calls are also open to participants from non-associated countries, ‘Third Countries’, and international organisations, unless specific limitations or conditions are laid down in the work programme and/or the call/topic text, such as those highlighted for associated countries above.

Any updates and details which will be derived following e.g. the entry into force of association agreements, the list of Associated Countries, etc. can be found in the aforementioned documents.
Exceptions shall be addressed by the specific work programmes and calls.

,15850,"Under Horizon Europe Health cluster, is it mandatory or optional to plan the participation of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in the project for the topics where the JRC participation is eligible?","It is optional. The General annexes to the Work Programme indicate the following: Joint Research Centre — Where provided for in the specific call conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC would accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding and would accede to the consortium as a member.

,15769,"Under Horizon Europe, when the ‘Clinical study template’ is not mandatory, does this mean that clinical studies are not expected for proposals under the topics not listed in the template?","Despite the fact that a call topic is not listed in the ‘Clinical study template’, clinical studies may still be relevant for that particular topic. In such a case, however, the use of the template is not mandatory.
",13/07/2021,FALSE
,15767,"Under Horizon Europe, it looks like the ‘Clinical study template’ refers mainly to interventions.

,15763,"Under Horizon Europe, is there a clear definition on what is a clinical study? In the case of application of a diagnostic tool without intervention - is this a clinical study?","If the application of the diagnostic tool is pursued in a scientific endeavour that meets the definition of clinical study as provided in the ‘Clinical study template’, then it is considered a clinical study for the purpose of applying for funding under the call topics listed in the template. On the contrary, if, for example, one of the objectives of the study is to collect data on the willingness to pay for the diagnostic tool by the intended user but no health related information that is linked, for example, to the performance of the medical device is gathered, then this activity would not meet the definition of a clinical study.
",13/07/2021,FALSE

,15485,"What does the ""Do No Significant Harm"" principle mean in the context of Horizon Europe?","The Commission Communication on the European Green Deal introduced green oath to “do no harm”. The “Do No Significant Harm” (DNSH) principle has been further specified in the EU Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments, commonly defined as the EU Taxonomy. Six environmental objectives are listed in Article 9 of the EU Taxonomy (climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems) and Article 17 specifies what can constitute a ‘significant harm’ for these 6 environmental objectives:

An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change mitigation if it leads to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change adaptation if it leads to an increased adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate, on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets;
An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources if it is detrimental to the good status or the good ecological potential of bodies of water, including surface water and groundwater, or to the good environmental status of marine waters;
An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the circular economy, including waste prevention and recycling, if it leads to significant inefficiencies in the use of materials or in the direct or indirect use of natural resources, or if it significantly increases the generation, incineration or disposal of waste, or if the long-term disposal of waste may cause significant and long-term environmental harm;
An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to pollution prevention and control if it leads to a significant increase in emissions of pollutants into air, water or land;
An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems if it is significantly detrimental to the good condition and resilience of ecosystems, or detrimental to the conservation status of habitats and species, including those of Union interest.

References on the DNSH principle are included in the General Introduction of the Work Programme 2021-2022 of Horizon Europe Pillar II and in Cluster 4 (Digital, Industry and Space), Cluster 5 (Climate, Energy and Mobility), and Cluster 6 (Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment) because of their particular relevance for environmental outcomes and impacts. At programming stage, the Horizon Europe work programme has been co-created to support research and innovation activities that respect climate and environmental priorities of the Union and cause no significant harm to them.
At project level, the reference to the DNSH principle in the Horizon Europe Work Programme is included in the application form (proposal part B template) to offer researchers the possibility to present the credential of their projects in relation to the DNSH principle. Applicants can refer to the DNSH principle when presenting their research methodology and the expected impacts of the project, to show that their project will not carry out activities that make a significant harm to any of the six environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation listed above.
However, evaluators will not score applications in relation to their compliance with the DNSH principle unless explicitly stated in the work programme (currently, this is the case only for actions in the European Innovation Council Work Programme 2021).

,15142,"Under Horizon Europe, where can one find examples of Gender Equality Plans (GEPs)?","The GEAR Tool provides a step-by-step guide on how to design and implement a GEP, and further examples can be found on the websites of EU-funded projects dedicated to the implementation of gender equality plans in R&amp;I organisations, including:

GEP implementing projects, such as those listed here
Communities of practice on GEPs: ACT
Training on GEPs and gender equality issues in R&amp;I: GE Academy
Evaluation framework and designing tools for gender equality measures in R&amp;I: EFFORTI

Additional guidance will also be provided by the European Commission.

,15139,Under Horizon Europe what happens if one consortium partner does not have a Gender Equality Plan (GEP) at Grant Agreement signature or if during compliance checks it's found out that a Beneficiary does not have a GEP fulfilling the mandatory requirements?,"A partner having declared they do not have a GEP cannot participate in a Horizon Europe project. The European Commission will carry out random compliance checks during the course of Horizon Europe. Standard procedures for non-compliance of beneficiaries to Horizon Europe eligibility criteria will then be implemented. In this case, the participation of that beneficiary will be terminated following the standard termination procedures which consist in sending a pre-information letter allowing beneficiaries to send observations prior to the final decision. Costs are eligible up to the termination date. Beneficiary terminations affect one specific beneficiary, not the entire consortium. However, if the beneficiary has a key role in the grant agreement, a beneficiary termination could trigger that the entire project may have to be terminated.

If all four mandatory requirements for the GEP are effectively covered through different institutional documents endorsed by top management, it can also be considered as being equivalent. In the latter case, we would then recommend that this information by gathered in a specific summary document which would be accessible on the organisation’s public website.
